# Quick Start Guide

This guide walks you through the essential steps to set up Tether for your organization. By the end, you'll have your first warehouse, collection, SKUs, and sales channel configured.

<Note>

</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Admin access to your Tether account
- Basic information about your products (names, SKU codes)
- Your warehouse location(s)
- Sales channel information

## Setup Checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your First Warehouse">
    Warehouses are where your inventory is stored. You need at least one warehouse to track inventory.

    1. Navigate to **Inventory** in the sidebar
    2. Click the **Warehouses** tab
    3. Click **Create Warehouse**
    4. Enter the warehouse details:
       - **Name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "Main Warehouse")
       - **Code**: A short identifier (e.g., "MAIN")
       - **Address**: Physical location (optional but recommended)
    5. Click **Save**

    <Tip>
      Use clear, consistent naming conventions for warehouses. This helps when you have multiple locations.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Collection">
    Collections group related products together and define shared attributes like dimensions.

    1. Navigate to **SKUs** in the sidebar
    2. Click the **Collections** tab
    3. Click **Create Collection**
    4. Enter collection details:
       - **Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "T-Shirts", "Electronics")
       - **Description**: Optional details about the collection
    5. Click **Save**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Dimensions (Optional)">
    Dimensions define product attributes like Size or Color. This is optional but powerful for managing variants.

    1. Open your newly created collection
    2. Go to the **Dimensions** tab
    3. Click **Add Dimension**
    4. Create dimensions like:
       - **Size**: S, M, L, XL
       - **Color**: Red, Blue, Black
    5. Save each dimension

    <Info>
      Dimensions enable the SKU Generator, which can automatically create all variant combinations for you.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Your First SKUs">
    SKUs are individual products in your catalog. You can create them manually or generate them from dimensions.

    **Option A: Create Manually**
    1. Navigate to **SKUs** in the sidebar
    2. Click **Create SKU**
    3. Enter SKU details:
       - **Name**: Product name
       - **SKU Code**: Unique identifier
       - **Type**: Usually "Finished Good" for sellable products
       - **Collection**: Select your collection
    4. Click **Save**

    **Option B: Generate from Dimensions**
    1. Open your collection
    2. Go to the **SKUs** tab
    3. Click **SKU Generator**
    4. Select the dimension values to include
    5. Click **Generate** to create all combinations
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure a Sales Channel">
    Channels represent where you sell products (Shopify, Amazon, wholesale, etc.).

    1. Navigate to **Channels** in the sidebar
    2. Click **Create Channel**
    3. Enter channel details:
       - **Name**: Channel name (e.g., "Shopify US", "Amazon")
       - **Type**: Select the appropriate type
    4. Click **Save**
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Your Inventory Dashboard">
    Now that you have the basics set up, explore your inventory dashboard.

    1. Navigate to **Inventory** in the sidebar
    2. The **Overview** tab shows:
       - Inventory health alerts
       - Stockout risks
       - Safety stock breaches
    3. Use filters to focus on specific warehouses or collections

    <Note>
      Inventory levels will show as zero until you import data or set up integrations.
