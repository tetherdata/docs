    - Lead time
    - Cost
    - Minimum order quantity
    - Supplier SKU code

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Capability Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|

Lot Size: 50 units
Priority: 1 (Primary supplier)
```

## Lead Times

Lead times are critical for supply planning.

### Components of Lead Time

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Order Processing** | Time for supplier to process order |
| **Manufacturing** | Time to produce (if made-to-order) |
| **Shipping** | Transit time to your warehouse |
| **Customs** | International shipping delays |
| **Receiving** | Time to receive and stock |

### Setting Lead Times

Enter the total lead time that covers all components.

<Info>
  Use realistic lead times. Overly optimistic times lead to stockouts. Add buffer for reliability.
</Info>

### Different Lead Times

Consider variations:

| Situation | Adjustment |
|-----------|------------|
| Standard order | Base lead time |
| Rush order | Shorter (if supplier offers) |
| Peak season | Add buffer for delays |
| New relationship | Add buffer until proven |

## Cost Configuration

Track costs for purchasing decisions and margin analysis.

### Cost Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Base Cost** | Standard unit price |
| **Currency** | Cost currency |
| **Volume Discounts** | Price breaks at quantities |
| **Effective Date** | When pricing is valid |

### Volume Pricing

Configure price breaks:

| Quantity | Cost per Unit |
|----------|---------------|
| 1-99 | $10.00 |
| 100-499 | $9.00 |
| 500-999 | $8.50 |
| 1000+ | $8.00 |

## Multiple Suppliers

Many SKUs have multiple potential suppliers.

### Why Multiple Suppliers

- **Backup** - Alternative if primary can't deliver
- **Capacity** - Primary can't meet full demand
- **Geographic** - Different suppliers for different regions
- **Cost** - Price competition

### Supplier Priority

Set priority to indicate preference:

| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | Primary supplier (first choice) |
| 2 | Secondary supplier |
| 3+ | Backup suppliers |

### How Tether Uses Priority

1. Recommendations use highest priority supplier
2. If capacity exceeded, moves to next priority
3. Can manually override for specific orders

## Supplier Status

Suppliers can be Active or Inactive:

| Status | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Active** | Available for orders and recommendations |
| **Inactive** | Not used in planning, data preserved |

### When to Deactivate

- Relationship ended
- Quality issues
- Temporary suspension

<Note>
  Deactivating doesn't delete history. Past transactions and costs remain for reporting.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Complete All Capabilities">
    For supply planning to work well:

## Suppliers in Supply Planning

Supplier data powers the supply plan:

### Order Recommendations

Tether recommends orders based on:
1. Demand forecast
2. Current inventory
3. Supplier lead times
4. Minimum order quantities

### Order Timing

```
Stockout projected: Day 30
Lead time: 14 days
Order must be placed by: Day 16
```

### Supplier Selection

Recommendations use:
1. Primary supplier (Priority 1)
2. Unless capacity issue → Secondary
3. Unless specified → Manual override

## Troubleshooting

### Supplier Not Appearing in Recommendations

**Possible causes:**
- No capabilities configured
- Supplier is inactive
- Priority is lower than alternatives

**Solutions:**
1. Add capabilities for relevant SKUs
2. Verify supplier is active
3. Check priority settings

### Wrong Supplier Recommended

**Possible causes:**
- Priority misconfigured
- Cost or lead time favors other supplier
- Capacity constraints

**Solutions:**
1. Review and adjust priorities
2. Manually select preferred supplier when ordering
3. Check capacity settings
