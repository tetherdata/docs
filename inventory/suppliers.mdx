# Suppliers

Suppliers are the vendors who provide your products and materials. Tether helps you manage supplier information, capabilities, and costs for effective supply planning.

## What is a Supplier?

A supplier is any external party that provides goods to your business:

- Product manufacturers

## Supplier Detail View

Click on a supplier to see full details. The detail page has the following tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Overview** | Supplier details and SKU capabilities table |
| **Transactions** | Transaction history with this supplier |
| **Inventory** | Inventory held by this supplier (if linked warehouse exists) |
| **Inventory Settings** | SKU-warehouse assignments for the supplier's linked warehouse |
| **Lead Times** | Transit lead times from supplier's linked warehouse to other warehouses |

<Note>
  The **Inventory**, **Inventory Settings**, and **Lead Times** tabs are fully functional only when a supplier has a linked warehouse. Otherwise, they display a message indicating no warehouse is linked.
</Note>

### Overview Tab

The Overview tab contains two main sections:

1. **Supplier Details** — Editable form showing name, code, description, address, and contact information. Click **Edit** to modify.
2. **SKU Capabilities** — Data table showing which products this supplier provides and the terms for each.

## Supplier Capabilities

Capabilities define what SKUs a supplier can provide and the terms for each.

### Capabilities Table Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Collection** | Product collection the SKU belongs to (links to collection page) |
| **Type** | SKU type (e.g., Finished Good, Raw Material) |
| **SKU Code** | Product code identifier |
| **SKU Name** | Product name (links to SKU detail page) |
| **Lead Time (days)** | Production/delivery lead time in days |
| **MOQ** | Minimum order quantity |
| **Cost** | Total cost per unit, with breakdown by cost items |
| **Unit** | Unit of measurement for ordering |
| **Vendor SKU** | Supplier's internal code for this product |

### Viewing and Filtering Capabilities

The capabilities table supports several filters:

- **Product Hierarchy** — Filter by hierarchy fields (if configured)
- **Collection** — Filter by product collection
- **SKU** — Filter by specific SKUs
- **Status Toggle** — Switch between **All**, **Enabled** (SKUs with capabilities), and **Disabled** (SKUs without capabilities)

### Editing Capabilities

Click on any editable field (Lead Time, MOQ, Vendor SKU) to modify it inline:

1. Click the field value to enter edit mode
2. Type the new value
3. Press **Enter** or click away to confirm
4. Pending changes are highlighted in blue
5. Click **Save** to save all pending changes, or **Discard** to revert

### Bulk Editing

Apply settings to multiple SKUs at once:

1. Set values in the **Lead Time** and/or **MOQ** bulk input fields
2. Click **Apply to N Enabled** to apply those values to all enabled (with capabilities) SKUs matching the current filters

## Cost Configuration

Costs are managed through a **cost items** approach, where each SKU's total cost is composed of individual cost components.

### How Cost Items Work

Each SKU-supplier combination can have multiple cost items that sum to the total cost per unit:

| Cost Item | Cost per Unit |
|-----------|---------------|
| Raw Material | $5.00 |
| Manufacturing | $2.50 |
| Packaging | $1.00 |
| **Total** | **$8.50** |

### Managing Cost Items

Click on the **Cost** column for any SKU to open the cost breakdown popover:

1. **View** — See all cost items and their amounts
2. **Add** — Enter a cost name and amount, then click the **+** button
3. **Edit** — Modify existing cost item names or amounts inline
4. **Delete** — Remove a cost item by clicking the trash icon
5. **Save** — Click **Save** to apply changes (only appears when changes are pending)

<Info>
  Cost is always expressed per the SKU's default unit of measurement.
</Info>

## Supplier Lead Times

Lead times for each SKU are configured directly in the capabilities table.

### Setting Lead Times

1. Navigate to the supplier's **Overview** tab
2. Find the SKU in the capabilities table
3. Click the **Lead Time (days)** value
4. Enter the total lead time in days
5. Save changes

### What Lead Time Includes

The lead time value should account for the total time from placing an order to having inventory available:

- Order processing time
- Manufacturing time (if made-to-order)
- Shipping time to your warehouse
- Customs clearance (if international)
- Receiving and stocking time

<Info>
  Use realistic lead times. Overly optimistic times lead to stockouts. Add buffer for reliability.
</Info>

## Supplier Held Inventory

Some suppliers hold inventory on your behalf in a linked warehouse. This is the **Supplier Held Inventory** feature.

### How It Works

A supplier can be linked to a specific warehouse (the `linked_warehouse_id`). When linked:

- The **Inventory** tab shows inventory at the supplier's linked warehouse
- The **Inventory Settings** tab allows configuring SKU-warehouse assignments for the linked warehouse
- The **Lead Times** tab shows transit lead times from the supplier's linked warehouse to your other warehouses (using the same interface as warehouse lead time configuration)

### When to Use

Supplier Held Inventory is useful when:

- A supplier maintains stock in their own facility on your behalf
- You need to track inventory at a supplier's location
- Transfer times from the supplier's warehouse to yours need to be configured

## Suppliers in Supply Planning

Supplier data powers the supply plan:

### Order Recommendations

Tether recommends orders based on:
1. Demand forecast
2. Current inventory levels
3. Supplier lead times for each SKU
4. Minimum order quantities

### Order Timing

```
Stockout projected: Day 30
Lead time: 14 days
Order must be placed by: Day 16
```

## Supplier Status

Suppliers can be Active or Inactive:

| Status | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Active** | Available for orders and recommendations |
| **Inactive** | Not used in planning, data preserved |

### When to Deactivate

- Relationship ended
- Quality issues
- Temporary suspension

<Note>
  Deactivating doesn't delete history. Past transactions and costs remain for reporting.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Complete All Capabilities">
    For supply planning to work well:
    - Add capabilities for all SKUs each supplier provides
    - Set accurate lead times
    - Include cost information with detailed cost items
    - Define minimum order quantities
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Detailed Cost Breakdown">
    Break costs into components for better analysis:
    - Separate raw material, manufacturing, and packaging costs
    - Makes it easier to identify cost optimization opportunities
    - Provides transparency into total cost composition
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Updates">
    Keep information current:
    - Review lead times quarterly
    - Update costs when pricing changes
    - Verify contact information
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Terms">
    Use the description field to record:
    - Payment terms
    - Special agreements
    - Historical notes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Supplier Not Appearing in Recommendations

**Possible causes:**
- No capabilities configured for the relevant SKUs
- Supplier is inactive
- Lead times not set

**Solutions:**
1. Add capabilities for relevant SKUs
2. Verify supplier is active
3. Set lead times in the capabilities table

### Inventory/Lead Times Tabs Show "No Warehouse Linked"

**Possible cause:**
- Supplier doesn't have a linked warehouse configured

**Solution:**
The Inventory, Inventory Settings, and Lead Times tabs require a linked warehouse. These tabs are used for the Supplier Held Inventory feature. If the supplier doesn't hold inventory for you, this is expected behavior.

### Cost Not Showing

**Possible cause:**
- No cost items have been configured for the SKU

**Solution:**
1. Click the cost cell for the SKU
2. Add cost items with names and amounts
3. Save changes
