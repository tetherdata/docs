# Supply Plan

The Supply Plan is where you manage replenishment orders—both system-recommended and user-created. It's your action center for keeping inventory at optimal levels.

## Accessing the Supply Plan

Navigate to **Inventory** → **Supply Plan** tab.

## Understanding the Supply Plan

The Supply Plan shows all scheduled replenishment orders:

- **System Recommendations** - Orders Tether suggests based on forecasts
- **User-Created Orders** - Orders you've manually added
- **Draft Transactions** - Orders in preparation

### Order Types

| Type | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Purchase Order** | 📦 | Order from a supplier |
| **Transfer Order** | 🔄 | Move inventory between warehouses |
| **Production Order** | 🏭 | Internal manufacturing |

## Viewing Scheduled Orders

The Supply Plan displays orders in a table format:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Order Date** | When the order should be placed |
| **Type** | Purchase, Transfer, or Production |
| **Source** | Supplier or source warehouse |
| **Destination** | Destination warehouse |
| **Alert Level** | Urgency (Urgent, Important, Normal) |
| **Status** | Scheduled, Draft, In Progress |
| **Line Items** | Number of SKUs in the order |
| **Total** | Order value (if applicable) |

### Order Sources

Orders are marked by their creation source:

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **System** | Generated by Tether's recommendation engine |
| **User** | Manually created by a user |

## System Recommendations

Tether continuously analyzes your inventory and demand to recommend optimal orders.

### How Recommendations Work

The recommendation engine considers:

1. **Current Inventory** - Stock levels across warehouses
2. **Demand Forecast** - Projected consumption
3. **Lead Times** - Supplier and transfer times
4. **Safety Stock** - Target buffer levels
5. **Order Constraints** - Minimum quantities, lot sizes

### Viewing Recommendation Details

Click on a recommended order to see:

- **SKU Details** - What to order and quantities
- **Timing Logic** - Why this date was chosen
- **Impact Analysis** - How this order affects inventory
- **Alternative Options** - Other suppliers or timing

## Filtering the Supply Plan

### By Order Type

Show only specific order types:
- Purchase Orders
- Transfer Orders
- Production Orders

### By Alert Level

Focus on urgency:
- **Urgent** - Requires immediate action
- **Important** - Should be addressed soon
- **Normal** - Standard planning

### By Warehouse

Filter by destination warehouse to see orders for specific locations.

### By Date Range

View orders within a specific time window:
- Next 7 days
- Next 30 days
- Custom date range

## Alert Levels Explained

| Level | Criteria | Recommended Action |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Urgent** | Stockout within lead time | Place order immediately |
| **Important** | Safety stock breach expected | Order within 1-2 days |
| **Normal** | Routine replenishment | Order per normal schedule |

## Order Timeline

Understanding order timing:

```
Today → Order Date → Ship Date → Receive Date
         ↓            ↓           ↓
    Place order   Leaves      Arrives at
    with supplier  supplier   warehouse
```

### Lead Time Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Supplier Lead Time** | Time from order to shipment |
| **Transit Time** | Shipping duration |
| **Processing Time** | Receiving and stocking |
| **Total Lead Time** | Sum of all components |

## Reconciling the Supply Plan

Periodically review your supply plan:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review All Orders">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Outdated Items">

## Integration with Transactions

When you create a draft from the supply plan:

1. **Draft Created** - Transaction is created in Draft status
2. **Editable** - You can still modify details
3. **Submit** - Submit to begin order processing
4. **In Progress** - Order is being fulfilled
5. **Completed** - Inventory is received

See [Transactions](/transactions/overview) for more on the transaction lifecycle.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review Daily">
    Check the supply plan at least daily:
    - New urgent recommendations
    - Orders approaching their order date
    - Changes in demand affecting plans
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Act on Urgent Items">
    Don't let urgent orders sit:
    - Process within 24 hours
    - If you can't order, investigate why
    - Adjust settings if recommendations are wrong
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch Similar Orders">
    Consider combining orders:
    - Multiple SKUs from same supplier
    - Orders shipping to same warehouse
    - Orders with similar timing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verify Before Creating Drafts">
    Double-check recommendations:
    - Are quantities reasonable?
    - Is the supplier correct?
    - Does timing make sense?
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### No Recommendations Showing

**Possible causes:**
- No inventory issues projected
- Settings not configured (suppliers, lead times)
- Forecast data missing

**Solutions:**
1. Check inventory alerts on Overview tab
2. Verify supplier capabilities are configured
3. Ensure demand forecasts exist

### Recommendations Seem Wrong

**Possible causes:**
- Incorrect lead times
- Forecast is inaccurate
- Safety stock settings off

**Solutions:**
1. Verify supplier lead times
2. Review demand forecast accuracy
3. Adjust safety stock thresholds
