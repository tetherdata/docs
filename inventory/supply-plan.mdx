# Supply Plan

The Supply Plan is where you manage replenishment orders — both system-recommended and user-created. It's your action center for keeping inventory at optimal levels.

## Accessing the Supply Plan

Navigate to **Inventory** → **Supply Plan** tab.

## Understanding the Supply Plan

The Supply Plan tab is organized into three sections:

### In Supply Plan

Transactions that are currently part of your active supply plan. These are draft transactions with the `in_supply_plan` flag set to true. They drive the User Plan Forecast and represent your intended replenishment strategy.

### Draft Transactions (Not in Plan)

Draft transactions that you've created but haven't added to the supply plan yet. These are available for review and can be added to the plan when ready.

### System Recommendations

Orders that Tether's simulation engine has generated based on your demand forecast, current inventory, lead times, and safety stock settings. These are automatically recalculated when the system simulation runs.

<Info>
  System-recommended orders are regenerated each time the system simulation runs. If you want to preserve a recommendation, convert it to a draft transaction.
</Info>

## Order Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Purchase Order** | Order from a supplier |
| **Transfer Order** | Move inventory between your warehouses |

### Order Sources

Each order displays a badge indicating how it was created:

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **System Recommended** | Generated by Tether's simulation engine |
| **User Created** | Manually created by a user |

## Working with System Recommendations

Tether continuously analyzes your inventory and demand to recommend optimal orders.

### How Recommendations Work

The recommendation engine considers:

1. **Current Inventory** — Stock levels across warehouses
2. **[Demand Forecast](/demand-forecasting/dashboard)** — Projected consumption over time
3. **Lead Times** — Supplier and transfer lead times
4. **Safety Stock** — Target buffer levels per SKU/warehouse
5. **Order Constraints** — Minimum order quantities and lot sizes

### Recommendation Details

Click on a system recommendation to see its details:

- **Line Items** — SKUs, quantities, and target land dates
- **Alert Level** — The urgency level that triggered this recommendation
- **Source** — Which supplier or warehouse the order comes from
- **Destination** — Which warehouse will receive the inventory

### Converting Recommendations to Drafts

Convert a system recommendation to a draft transaction you own:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the Recommendation">
    Click on a system recommendation in the System Recommendations section
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Details">
    Verify the SKUs, quantities, and timing
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Add to Plan">
    Click **Add to Plan** to convert the recommendation into a draft transaction and add it to your supply plan
  </Step>

  <Step title="Draft Created">
    The recommendation is converted to a user-owned draft transaction. Unlike system recommendations, draft transactions are preserved when the simulation is re-run.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Working with Draft Transactions

### Adding Drafts to the Supply Plan

For draft transactions not yet in the plan:

1. Find the transaction in the **Draft Transactions** section
2. Click **Add to Plan**
3. The transaction moves to the **In Supply Plan** section and will be included in the User Plan Forecast

### Removing from the Supply Plan

To remove a transaction from your supply plan:

1. Find the transaction in the **In Supply Plan** section
2. Click **Remove from Plan**
3. The transaction moves back to **Draft Transactions** and is no longer factored into the User Plan Forecast

### Deleting Draft Transactions

Only user-created draft transactions can be deleted. System-recommended orders cannot be individually deleted — they are managed by the simulation engine.

1. Select the user-created draft transaction
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
  Deleting a draft transaction is permanent. If you only want to exclude it from forecasting, use **Remove from Plan** instead.
</Warning>

## Bulk Actions

Work with multiple orders at once using checkboxes:

### In Supply Plan Section

- **Remove from Plan** — Remove selected transactions from the supply plan
- **Delete Selected** — Delete selected user-created drafts (system-recommended drafts cannot be deleted)

### Draft Transactions Section

- **Add to Plan** — Add selected drafts to the supply plan

### System Recommendations Section

- **Add to Plan** — Convert selected recommendations to drafts and add to the supply plan
- **Replace Plan** — Replace all current supply plan transactions with the selected recommendations

<Warning>
  **Replace Plan** removes all existing transactions from the supply plan and replaces them with newly created drafts from the selected system recommendations. Use this when you want to align your plan with the system's recommendations.
</Warning>

## Supply Plan and Forecasting

The Supply Plan directly drives the **User Plan Forecast**:

- Transactions **in the supply plan** are included in the User Plan Forecast projection
- Transactions **not in the supply plan** are excluded from forecast calculations
- The system runs a separate **System Recommendations Forecast** for comparison

This dual-forecast approach lets you compare your current plan against what the system recommends, helping you identify gaps and opportunities.

## Alert Levels

Recommendations and alerts are categorized by severity:

| Level | Criteria | Recommended Action |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Urgent** | Stockout is imminent or occurring | Place order immediately |
| **Important** | Safety stock breach projected | Order within 1-2 days |
| **Overstock** | Excess inventory above threshold | Consider reducing orders |
| **Expedite** | Plan can be improved with timing changes | Review and adjust timing |
| **Plan Good** | Current plan covers the issue | No action needed |

## Integration with Transactions

When you submit a draft from the supply plan:

1. **Draft** — Transaction is in Draft status, editable and part of your plan
2. **Submitted** — Transaction is submitted to begin order processing
3. **In Progress** — Order is being fulfilled
4. **Completed** — Inventory is received

See [Transactions](/transactions/overview) for more on the transaction lifecycle.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review Daily">
    Check the supply plan at least daily:
    - Review new system recommendations
    - Check orders approaching their submission date
    - Verify that your plan covers upcoming demand
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Act on Urgent Items">
    Don't let urgent recommendations sit:
    - Convert to drafts and submit within 24 hours
    - If you can't order, investigate why
    - Adjust settings if recommendations are consistently wrong
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Replace Plan Carefully">
    The Replace Plan action is powerful:
    - Review system recommendations before replacing
    - Understand why system recommendations differ from your plan
    - Use when you want to fully realign with the system's analysis
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verify Before Submitting">
    Double-check drafts before submission:
    - Are quantities reasonable?
    - Is the supplier or source correct?
    - Does timing make sense given lead times?
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### No Recommendations Showing

**Possible causes:**
- No inventory issues projected within the forecast horizon
- Supplier capabilities not configured (lead times, MOQ)
- Demand forecast data missing

**Solutions:**
1. Check inventory alerts on the Overview tab
2. Verify supplier capabilities are configured
3. Ensure demand forecasts exist for the relevant SKUs
4. Click **Refresh** to re-run the supply simulation

### Recommendations Seem Wrong

**Possible causes:**
- Incorrect lead times configured
- Demand forecast is inaccurate
- Safety stock settings are too high or too low

**Solutions:**
1. Verify supplier lead times in supplier capabilities
2. Review demand forecast accuracy
3. Adjust safety stock thresholds in inventory settings
