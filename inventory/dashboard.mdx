# Inventory Dashboard

The Inventory Dashboard is your central hub for monitoring inventory health, identifying issues, and taking action to prevent stockouts and overstocks.

<Note>
  The Inventory Dashboard is available to Admin users only. Sales Rep users should use the Demand Forecast views.
</Note>

## Accessing the Dashboard

Navigate to **Inventory** in the sidebar. The dashboard opens to the Overview tab by default.

## Dashboard Tabs

The Inventory page has four main tabs:

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Overview** | Alerts and health status summary |
| **Inventory** | Current stock levels across warehouses |
| **Forecast** | Inventory projection charts and flow diagrams |
| **Supply Plan** | Scheduled orders and recommendations |

## Overview Tab

The Overview tab provides a snapshot of your inventory health across all warehouses and SKUs.

### Alert Summary Cards

At the top, summary cards show counts of alerts by issue type. Click a card to filter the alert table to that issue type.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Stockout Alerts" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    SKUs projected to run out of stock
  </Card>
  <Card title="Safety Stock Breaches" icon="shield-exclamation">
    SKUs projected to fall below safety stock thresholds
  </Card>
  <Card title="Overstock Alerts" icon="boxes-packing">
    SKUs with excess inventory above overstock thresholds
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Understanding Alert Levels

Alerts are categorized into five levels based on severity:

| Level | Color | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Urgent** | Red | Immediate action required — stockout is imminent or already occurring |
| **Important** | Orange | Action needed soon — safety stock breach is projected |
| **Overstock** | Yellow | Excess inventory detected above overstock thresholds |
| **Expedite** | Blue | Existing plan can be improved — consider adjusting order timing |
| **Plan Good** | Green | Your current plan already covers the issue |

### Alert Table

The main table shows individual alerts for each SKU/warehouse pairing:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Alert** | Alert level badge (Urgent, Important, Overstock, Expedite, Plan Good) |
| **SKU** | Product name with link to SKU detail |
| **Warehouse** | Warehouse where the issue is detected |
| **Issues** | List of issue types (Stockout, Safety Stock Breach, Overstock) with date ranges |
| **Draft** | Indicator showing if a draft transaction already exists for this alert |

Click on any row to open the **Alert Resolution Modal** for detailed analysis and actions.

### Filtering Alerts

Filter the alert list using the controls at the top:

- **Warehouse** — Focus on specific locations
- **Collection** — Filter by product group
- **Days Ahead** — Set the projection horizon (e.g., 30, 60, 90, 180, or 360 days)

You can also click the alert summary cards to filter by issue type (Stockout, Safety Stock Breach, or Overstock).

### Alert Resolution Modal

Click on an alert row to open the Alert Resolution Modal, which provides:

- **Breach Timeline** — A left sidebar showing all issues for this SKU/warehouse with clickable breach periods
- **Projection Chart** — An inventory projection chart with six lines:
  - Current Plan inventory (solid blue)
  - System Plan inventory (solid green)
  - Current Safety Stock threshold (dashed orange)
  - System Safety Stock threshold (dotted orange)
  - Current Overstock threshold (dashed red)
  - System Overstock threshold (dotted red)
- **Issue Details** — Specific information about the selected breach period, including date range and severity
- **Draft vs. System Comparison** — Side-by-side view of any existing draft transaction and the system's recommended order
- **Actions** — Navigate between alerts using arrow buttons, or view the full scheduled order details

## Inventory Health Status

Each SKU/warehouse combination has a health status determined by the supply simulation:

| Status | Meaning | Typical Action |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Healthy** | Stock levels are within target range | No action needed |
| **Low Inventory** | Below target but above safety stock | Plan replenishment |
| **Out of Stock** | Zero sellable inventory | Emergency order |
| **Overstock** | Above overstock threshold | Reduce orders or promote sales |

<Info>
  Health statuses are computed from daily inventory snapshots generated by the supply simulation engine. Each snapshot records the projected inventory level and its health classification for that day.
</Info>

## Inventory States

Tether tracks inventory in different states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Sellable** | Available for sale |
| **On Hand** | Physically in warehouse |
| **Committed** | Reserved for orders |
| **Incoming** | In transit or on order |
| **Damaged** | Not available for sale |

### Understanding the Relationship

```
On Hand = Sellable + Committed + Damaged
Available to Promise = Sellable + Incoming
```

## Refreshing Simulation Data

The Overview tab includes a **Refresh** button that triggers both User and System supply simulations. This recalculates all inventory projections, alerts, and recommendations based on the latest data.

<Tip>
  Use the Refresh button after making changes to inventory settings, safety stock levels, or supplier capabilities to see updated alerts.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Daily Review">
    Check the dashboard daily:
    - Review new Urgent alerts first
    - Check Important alerts for upcoming safety stock breaches
    - Monitor Overstock alerts to prevent excess inventory
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Address Urgent First">
    Prioritize by alert level:
    1. Handle Urgent alerts immediately — these indicate imminent stockouts
    2. Plan for Important alerts — schedule replenishment before breaches occur
    3. Review Overstock and Expedite alerts periodically
    4. Plan Good alerts confirm your current plan is working
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Filters Strategically">
    Different filters for different purposes:
    - No filter for an overall health check
    - Warehouse filter for location-specific review
    - Collection filter for product line analysis
    - Click summary cards to focus on specific issue types
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Look Beyond Today">
    Extend the time horizon:
    - Short-term (30 days) for operations
    - Medium-term (90 days) for planning
    - Long-term (180+ days) for strategy
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
