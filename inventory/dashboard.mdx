# Inventory Dashboard

The Inventory Dashboard is your central hub for monitoring inventory health, identifying issues, and taking action to prevent stockouts and overstocks.

<Note>
  The Inventory Dashboard is available to Admin users only. Sales Rep users should use the Demand Forecast views.
</Note>

## Accessing the Dashboard

Navigate to **Inventory** in the sidebar. The dashboard opens to the Overview tab by default.

## Dashboard Tabs

The Inventory page has four main tabs:

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Overview** | Alerts and health status summary |
| **Supply Plan** | Scheduled orders and recommendations |
| **Forecast** | Inventory projection charts |
| **Flow** | Visual replenishment diagram |

## Overview Tab

The Overview tab provides a snapshot of your inventory health.

### Alert Summary Cards

At the top, summary cards show:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Stockout Alerts" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    SKUs at risk of running out of stock
  </Card>
  <Card title="Safety Stock Breaches" icon="shield-exclamation">
    SKUs falling below safety thresholds
  </Card>
  <Card title="Overstock Alerts" icon="boxes-packing">
    SKUs with excess inventory
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Understanding Alert Levels

Alerts are categorized by urgency:

| Level | Icon | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Urgent** | 🔴 | Immediate action required (stockout imminent) |
| **Important** | 🟡 | Action needed soon (safety stock breach) |
| **Info** | 🔵 | Awareness item (overstock or minor issue) |

### Alert Table

The main table shows individual alerts with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Alert Level** | Urgency indicator |
| **SKU** | Product name and code |
| **Warehouse** | Location of the issue |
| **Current Stock** | Current inventory level |
| **Coverage Days** | Days until stockout at current rate |
| **Health Status** | Overall inventory health |
| **Actions** | Quick action buttons |

### Filtering Alerts

Filter the alert list by:

- **Warehouse** - Focus on specific locations
- **Collection** - Filter by product group
- **Days Ahead** - 30, 60, 90, 180, or 360 days projection
- **Alert Level** - Show only urgent, important, or info

### Taking Action on Alerts

Click on an alert to open the Alert Resolution Modal:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Alert Details">
    See current stock, consumption rate, and projected stockout date
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Recommendations">
    Tether shows suggested actions:
    - Recommended order quantity
    - Suggested order date
    - Available suppliers
  </Step>

  <Step title="Take Action">
    Options include:
    - Add to supply plan
    - Create purchase order
    - Create transfer order
    - Dismiss alert (with reason)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Inventory Health Status

Each SKU/warehouse combination has a health status:

| Status | Meaning | Typical Action |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Healthy** | Stock levels are good | No action needed |
| **Low Inventory** | Below target but above safety stock | Plan replenishment |
| **Safety Stock Breach** | Below safety stock threshold | Order urgently |
| **Out of Stock** | Zero sellable inventory | Emergency order |
| **Overstock** | Above maximum threshold | Reduce orders, promote sales |

## Coverage Days

Coverage days indicate how long current inventory will last based on consumption forecasts.

### How It's Calculated

```
Coverage Days = Current Sellable Inventory / Daily Consumption Rate
```

### Interpreting Coverage Days

| Coverage | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| **< 7 days** | Critical - immediate action needed |
| **7-14 days** | Urgent - order now |
| **15-30 days** | Plan replenishment |
| **31-60 days** | Healthy range (varies by product) |
| **> 60 days** | Consider if overstock |

<Info>
  Ideal coverage days vary by product and lead time. A product with 60-day lead time needs more coverage than one with 7-day lead time.
</Info>

## Inventory States

Tether tracks inventory in different states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Sellable** | Available for sale |
| **On Hand** | Physically in warehouse |
| **Committed** | Reserved for orders |
| **Incoming** | In transit or on order |
| **Damaged** | Not available for sale |

### Understanding the Relationship

```
On Hand = Sellable + Committed + Damaged
Available to Promise = Sellable + Incoming
```

## Filtering the Dashboard

### By Warehouse

Focus on specific warehouses:

1. Click the warehouse filter
2. Select one or more warehouses
3. All data updates to show only selected locations

### By Collection

Filter by product group:

1. Open the collection filter
2. Select collections to include
3. Alerts and metrics update accordingly

### By Time Horizon

Change the projection window:

| Option | Shows Alerts For |
|--------|------------------|
| **30 days** | Short-term issues |
| **60 days** | Medium-term planning |
| **90 days** | Standard planning horizon |
| **180 days** | Extended view |
| **360 days** | Annual planning |

<Tip>
  Start with 90 days for daily operations. Use longer horizons for strategic planning sessions.
</Tip>

## Dashboard Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

The dashboard shows several KPIs:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total SKUs** | Number of SKUs monitored |
| **SKUs at Risk** | SKUs with any alert |
