# Inventory Forecasts & Flow

The Forecast tab provides visual representations of your inventory projections and supply chain movements. It includes both a summary chart and a detailed forecast grid, along with a flow diagram view showing how inventory moves through your supply chain.

## Forecast Tab

Navigate to **Inventory** → **Forecast** tab.

### Visualization Toggle

The Forecast tab includes a toggle to switch between two visualization types:

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Chart** | Summary chart showing inventory, consumption, and replenishment over time |
| **Flow Diagram** | Visual diagram showing supply chain flows between suppliers, warehouses, and channels |

### Simulation Modes

Both views support two simulation modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **User** | Shows projections based on your current supply plan (draft transactions marked as in plan) |
| **System** | Shows projections based on system-generated recommendations |

When the chart is displayed, both User and System data are shown simultaneously with distinct color schemes. The selected mode controls which lines are emphasized with thicker strokes and solid colors.

## Summary Chart

The summary chart is a composed chart (bars + lines) showing key inventory metrics over time.

### Chart Elements

| Element | Visual | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Consumption** | Bars (orange) | Projected demand consumption per period |
| **Replenishment** | Bars (blue) | Incoming inventory from orders per period |
| **Inventory** | Line (black for User, gray for System) | Projected sellable inventory level |
| **Safety Stock** | Line (yellow) | Safety stock threshold |
| **Overstock** | Line (red) | Overstock threshold |

### Dual-Mode Display

Both User and System projections are displayed together:

- **User mode colors** — Solid, primary colors (orange consumption, blue replenishment, black inventory)
- **System mode colors** — Lighter, secondary colors (light orange, light blue, gray)

This side-by-side display helps you quickly see where your plan differs from the system's recommendations.

### Chart Interactions

- **Hover** — See exact values for any period
- **Legend** — Click legend items to show/hide individual data series
- **Period View** — Toggle between daily, weekly, and monthly aggregation

## Forecast Grid

Below the summary chart, the Forecast Grid displays detailed projection data in a hierarchical table using AG Grid.

### Grid Hierarchy

The grid is organized in a tree structure:

| Level | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Warehouse** | Top-level grouping by warehouse |
| **SKU** | Individual products within each warehouse |
| **Starting Inventory** | Sellable inventory at the start of each period |
| **Consumption** | Total demand consumption, expandable to show breakdown |
| **Replenishment** | Total incoming supply, expandable to show breakdown |
| **Ending Inventory** | Projected sellable inventory at end of each period |

### Consumption Breakdown

Expand the Consumption row to see a breakdown by source:

- **Direct Sales** — Consumption from sales channels
- **Transfers Out** — Inventory transferred to other warehouses
- **Bundle Consumption** — Inventory used in bundle/kit production
- **Production Consumption** — Materials consumed in manufacturing

### Replenishment Breakdown

Expand the Replenishment row to see incoming inventory by source:

- **Purchases** — Orders from suppliers
- **Transfers In** — Inventory received from other warehouses
- **Individual Transactions** — Each draft or submitted transaction is shown as its own row with:
  - Transaction name and reference number
  - Source type indicator (User Plan or System Recommended)
  - Active date range highlighting (blue shading for draft, green for submitted/in-progress)

### Dataset Visibility

Toggle which datasets are displayed:

| Mode | Shows |
|------|-------|
| **All** | Inventory, consumption, and replenishment together |
| **Inventory** | Only starting and ending inventory rows |
| **Consumption** | Only consumption rows |
| **Replenishment** | Only replenishment rows |

### Period Views

Switch between time aggregations:

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Daily** | Day-by-day projections |
| **Weekly** | Aggregated by week |
| **Monthly** | Aggregated by month |

### Filtering

Filter the forecast grid by:

- **Warehouse** — Focus on specific locations
- **SKU** — View specific products
- **Collection** — Filter by product group
- **Health Status** — Show only SKUs with specific health statuses (Out of Stock, Low Inventory, Overstock, Healthy)

### Exporting Data

Click the **Export** button to download the forecast grid data as a CSV file.

## Flow Diagram

Toggle to the **Flow Diagram** view to see a visual representation of inventory movements.

### Diagram Elements

| Element | Shape | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Supplier** | Node | External vendors providing inventory |
| **Warehouse** | Node | Inventory storage locations |
| **Channel** | Node | Sales channels and destinations |
| **Flow Edge** | Arrow | Movement of goods between nodes, with quantity labels |

### Flow Information

Each flow line shows:

- Direction of movement
- Quantity being moved
- Source and destination

### Filtering the Flow

Focus the diagram on specific aspects:

- **Date Range** — View flows within a specific time window
- **Warehouse** — Filter to flows involving specific warehouses
- **SKU/Collection** — Filter to specific products
- **Channel** — Focus on specific sales channels

## Using Forecasts for Planning

### Identifying Issues

Look for these patterns in the summary chart and grid:

| Pattern | Indicates | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Inventory drops below safety stock | Upcoming safety stock breach | Add replenishment orders |
| Inventory reaches zero | Projected stockout | Create urgent orders |
| Inventory stays above overstock line | Excess inventory | Reduce or delay orders |
| User and System projections diverge | Recommendations available | Review system recommendations |

### Comparing User vs. System Plans

Use the dual-mode display to compare your plan against the system:

1. **User mode** — Shows projections based on your current supply plan
2. **System mode** — Shows what the system recommends
3. **Gap** — Where the lines diverge represents improvement opportunities

<Tip>
  If the System projection shows better inventory health than your User plan, review the system's recommendations in the Supply Plan tab.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Regular Review Schedule">
    Check forecasts on a regular schedule:
    - Daily: Review next 2 weeks for urgent issues
    - Weekly: Review next 90 days for planning
    - Monthly: Review 6-12 month horizon for strategy
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Validate Assumptions">
    Use the forecast to validate:
    - Are lead times accurate? Check when replenishment appears vs. order dates
    - Is the demand forecast reasonable? Compare consumption against actuals
    - Are safety stock levels appropriate? Check how often breaches are projected
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compare Scenarios">
    Always compare User vs. System plans:
    - Understand the impact of system recommendations
    - Identify where your plan may have gaps
    - Make informed decisions about accepting recommendations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use the Grid for Detail">
    The forecast grid provides granular data:
    - Expand consumption to see which channels drive demand
    - Expand replenishment to see each incoming transaction
    - Use period views to match your planning cadence
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Chart Not Loading

**Possible causes:**
- [Supply simulation](/supply-simulation/running) hasn't been run yet
- Large dataset is loading
- Filters return no matching data

**Solutions:**
1. Click **Refresh** to trigger a new simulation
2. Wait for loading to complete
3. Adjust filters to ensure data exists for the selected criteria

### Unexpected Patterns

**Possible causes:**
- [Demand forecast](/demand-forecasting/dashboard) is inaccurate
- Lead times are misconfigured
- Transactions are not included in the supply plan

**Solutions:**
1. Verify demand forecast accuracy
2. Check lead time settings for warehouses and suppliers
3. Ensure relevant draft transactions are added to the supply plan
