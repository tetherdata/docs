# Warehouses Overview

Warehouses are the physical locations where your inventory is stored. In Tether, warehouses are essential for tracking stock levels, planning replenishment, and managing transfers.

## What is a Warehouse?

A warehouse represents any location that holds inventory:

- Distribution centers
- Retail stores
- 3PL facilities
- Manufacturing plants
- Fulfillment centers

## The Warehouses Dashboard

Navigate to **Inventory** → **Warehouses** to access the warehouse dashboard.

### Dashboard Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Warehouse List** | All warehouses displayed in a data table |
| **Search** | Find warehouses by name or code |
| **Create Button** | Add new warehouses |

## Creating a Warehouse

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Warehouses">
    Go to **Inventory** → **Warehouses**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Create Warehouse">
    Click the **Create Warehouse** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Warehouse Information">
    | Field | Required | Description |
    |-------|----------|-------------|
    | **Warehouse Code** | Yes | Short identifier (2-10 characters, letters, numbers, and underscores only) |
    | **Warehouse Name** | Yes | Descriptive display name (up to 100 characters) |
    | **Description** | No | Additional details about the warehouse (up to 500 characters) |

<Tip>
  Use clear, consistent naming. "NYC-01" is better than "Warehouse 1" when you have multiple locations.
</Tip>

## Warehouse Detail View

Click on a warehouse to open its detail page with multiple tabs:

### Overview Tab

The Overview tab displays basic warehouse information and lead time settings.

**Warehouse details shown:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Warehouse Code** | Short identifier |
| **Warehouse Name** | Display name |
| **Management** | Internally Managed or Externally Managed |

| **Contact Information** | Contact name, email, and phone (if set) |
| **Created Date** | When the warehouse was added |
| **Last Modified** | When the warehouse was last updated |

**Lead time settings** are also displayed in the Overview tab, showing transit lead times from this warehouse to other warehouses. See [Lead Time Configuration](/inventory/warehouses/lead-times) for details.

### Inventory Tab

View inventory at this warehouse:

- All SKUs with stock
- Inventory levels by state (sellable, committed, etc.)
- Health status indicators
- Quick filters

### Transactions Tab

## Externally Managed Warehouses

Warehouses can be flagged as **Externally Managed**:

| Management Type | Behavior |
|-----------------|----------|
| **Internally Managed** | Standard warehouse managed within Tether |
| **Externally Managed** | Warehouse managed by a third party (e.g., 3PL, supplier). Displayed with an "Externally Managed" badge |

<Note>
  Externally managed warehouses may be linked to suppliers. See [Supplier Held Inventory](/inventory/suppliers#supplier-held-inventory) for details.
</Note>

## Multi-Warehouse Operations

When you have multiple warehouses:

### Inventory Allocation

- Each SKU can have inventory in multiple warehouses
- Inventory is tracked separately by location
- Supply plan considers warehouse-specific needs

### Transfers

Move inventory between warehouses:

1. Create a Transfer Order
2. Specify source and destination
3. Select SKUs and quantities
4. Submit the transfer

### Fulfillment Rules

Configure which warehouses fulfill which channels:

- Warehouse A → Shopify US
- Warehouse B → Amazon
- Warehouse C → Wholesale

See [Inventory Settings](/administration/inventory-settings) for configuration.
