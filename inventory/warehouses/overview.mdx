# Warehouses Overview

Warehouses are the physical locations where your inventory is stored. In Tether, warehouses are essential for tracking stock levels, planning replenishment, and managing transfers.

## What is a Warehouse?

A warehouse represents any location that holds inventory:

- Distribution centers
- Retail stores
- 3PL facilities
- Manufacturing plants
- Fulfillment centers

## The Warehouses Dashboard

Navigate to **Inventory** → **Warehouses** to access the warehouse dashboard.

### Dashboard Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Warehouse List** | All warehouses with key information |
| **Search** | Find warehouses by name or code |
| **Status Filter** | Show active, inactive, or all |
| **Create Button** | Add new warehouses |

### Warehouse Information

Each warehouse shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Warehouse display name |
| **Code** | Short identifier |
| **Description** | Optional details |
| **Address** | Physical location |
| **Status** | Active or Inactive |

## Multi-Warehouse Operations

When you have multiple warehouses:

### Inventory Allocation

- Each SKU can have inventory in multiple warehouses
- Inventory is tracked separately by location
- Supply plan considers warehouse-specific needs

### Transfers

Move inventory between warehouses:

1. Create a Transfer Order
2. Specify source and destination
3. Select SKUs and quantities
4. Submit the transfer

### Fulfillment Rules

Configure which warehouses fulfill which channels:

- Warehouse A → Shopify US
- Warehouse B → Amazon
- Warehouse C → Wholesale

See [Inventory Settings](/administration/inventory-settings) for configuration.
