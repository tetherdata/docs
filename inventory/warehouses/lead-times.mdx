# Lead Time Configuration

Lead times determine how long it takes to move inventory between locations. Accurate lead times are essential for Tether to recommend orders at the right time.

## What Are Lead Times?

Lead time is the total time from when an order is placed until inventory is available at the destination.

### Lead Time Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Processing Time** | Time to prepare the order |
| **Transit Time** | Shipping duration |
| **Receiving Time** | Time to receive and stock |
| **Total Lead Time** | Sum of all components |

### Example Lead Time

```
Order placed Monday
+ 1 day processing
+ 3 days transit
+ 1 day receiving
= 5 days total lead time
= Available Saturday
```

## Types of Lead Times

### Supplier Lead Times

Time for orders from suppliers to reach your warehouse.

Configured in: **Supplier Settings** → **Capabilities**

### Transfer Lead Times

Time to move inventory between your warehouses.

Configured in: **Warehouse Settings** → **Lead Time**

### Production Lead Times

Time to manufacture products internally.

Configured in: **Transaction Settings** → **Production**

## Configuring Transfer Lead Times

### Accessing Lead Time Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Warehouse">
    Go to **Inventory** → **Warehouses**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Warehouse Detail">
    Click on a warehouse to open its settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to Lead Time Tab">
    Select the **Lead Time Settings** tab
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Setting Lead Times

Configure the time to transfer TO this warehouse from other locations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Source Warehouse">
    Choose the warehouse you're transferring FROM
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Lead Time">
    Specify the number of days:
    - **Total Days** - Combined lead time
    - Or break down by component if needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Save the lead time configuration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Repeat">
    Configure for each source warehouse
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Configuration

For a warehouse in New York receiving from other locations:

| From | To NYC | Lead Time |
|------|--------|-----------|
| LA Warehouse | NYC | 5 days |
| Chicago DC | NYC | 3 days |
| Atlanta | NYC | 4 days |

## The Lead Time Matrix

The lead time matrix shows transfer times between all warehouses.

### Accessing the Matrix

Navigate to **Inventory** → **Lead Times** (or through Settings).

### Matrix View

```
          To:   NYC    LA    CHI   ATL
From:
NYC             -      5     3     4
LA              5      -     4     5
CHI             3      4     -     3
ATL             4      5     3     -
```

### Editing in Matrix View

1. Click on any cell to edit
2. Enter the lead time in days
3. Changes save automatically

<Tip>
  Lead times are directional. NYC → LA might be different from LA → NYC due to shipping routes.
</Tip>

## Lead Times and Supply Planning

Lead times directly impact supply recommendations:

### How Tether Uses Lead Times

1. **Calculates order timing** - When to place orders to arrive on time
2. **Projects inventory** - When incoming stock will be available
3. **Generates alerts** - Warns when lead time exceeds coverage

### Example Calculation

```
Stockout projected: March 15
Transfer lead time: 5 days
Order should be placed by: March 10
```

If coverage drops below lead time, you'll see an urgent alert.

## Factors Affecting Lead Times

Consider these factors when setting lead times:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Distance** | Longer distance = longer transit |
| **Shipping Method** | Ground vs. air vs. expedited |
| **Carrier Reliability** | Add buffer for unreliable routes |
| **Processing Capacity** | Larger orders take longer to process |
| **Receiving Capacity** | Busy warehouses take longer to receive |
| **Seasonality** | Holiday periods may have delays |

## Buffer Time

Consider adding buffer to lead times:

### Why Add Buffer

- Account for delays
- Provide safety margin
- Handle variability

### How Much Buffer

| Situation | Suggested Buffer |
|-----------|------------------|
| Reliable routes | 0-1 days |
| Standard routes | 1-2 days |
| Unreliable routes | 2-3 days |
| International | 3-5 days |

### Example with Buffer

Actual transit time: 3 days
+ Processing: 1 day
+ Receiving: 1 day
+ Buffer: 1 day
= **Configured lead time: 6 days**

## Lead Time by SKU

Some configurations allow SKU-specific lead times:

### When to Use

- Bulky items that ship differently
- Special handling requirements
- Different suppliers for different SKUs

### Configuration

Set in supplier capabilities or SKU settings.

## Monitoring Lead Time Accuracy

Track actual vs. configured lead times:

### Review Process

1. Check transaction history for actual times
2. Compare to configured lead times
3. Adjust if consistently off

### Signs of Incorrect Lead Times

- Frequent stockouts despite orders in transit
- Inventory arriving earlier/later than projected
- Alerts don't align with actual urgency

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Conservative">
    When uncertain, use longer lead times:
    - Orders arrive early = extra safety stock
    - Orders arrive late = potential stockout
    - Better to have buffer than shortfall
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Regularly">
    Update lead times periodically:
    - Seasonal changes (holiday delays)
    - New shipping contracts
    - Route changes
    - Performance trends
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Assumptions">
    Keep notes on lead time configurations:
    - What components are included
    - What buffer is added
    - Why certain routes are longer
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider Variability">
    For routes with high variability:
    - Use the longer end of the range
    - Consider expedited shipping for urgent orders
    - Monitor closely during peak periods
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Orders Always Late

**Possible causes:**
- Lead time configured too short
- Not accounting for all components
- Carrier performance degraded

**Solutions:**
1. Review actual transit times
2. Add appropriate buffer
3. Consider faster shipping methods

### Orders Always Early

**Possible causes:**
- Lead time configured too long
- Carrier improved performance
- Processing time reduced

**Solutions:**
1. If consistently early, reduce lead time slightly
2. Early arrivals are usually acceptable
3. Don't over-correct—keep some buffer

### Inconsistent Results

**Possible causes:**
- High route variability
- Seasonal fluctuations
- Different carriers used

**Solutions:**
1. Use longer lead time to cover worst case
2. Review carrier selection
3. Consider average + buffer approach
