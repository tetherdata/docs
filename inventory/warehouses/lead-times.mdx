# Lead Time Configuration

Lead times determine how long it takes to move inventory between locations. Accurate lead times are essential for Tether to recommend orders at the right time and project when inventory will be available.

## What Are Lead Times?

Lead time is the total time from when an order is placed until inventory is available at the destination. In Tether, lead times are configured as **transit days** — the number of days for a shipment to travel from one location to another.

## Types of Lead Times

### Supplier Lead Times

Time for orders from suppliers to reach your warehouse. These are configured per SKU in supplier capabilities.

Configured in: **Supplier** → **Overview** → **Capabilities table** → **Lead Time** column

### Transfer Lead Times

Time to move inventory between your warehouses.

Configured in: **Warehouse** → **Overview** → **Transit Lead Times** section

## Configuring Transfer Lead Times

Transfer lead times are configured from within each warehouse's detail page.

### Accessing Lead Time Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Warehouse">
    Go to **Inventory** → **Warehouses**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Warehouse Detail">
    Click on a warehouse to open its settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Lead Times in Overview Tab">
    The **Overview** tab includes a "Transit Lead Times to Other Warehouses" section at the bottom
  </Step>
</Steps>

### The Lead Time Table

The lead time settings display a table showing all other warehouses with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Destination Warehouse** | The warehouse name and code (links to that warehouse's detail page) |
| **Lead Time (Days)** | The number of transit days to ship from the current warehouse to the destination |

### Setting Lead Times

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Destination Warehouse">
    Locate the destination warehouse in the table
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Transit Days">
    Click on the lead time input field and enter the number of transit days
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Update** to save, or press **Enter**. The lead time is automatically saved for both directions (e.g., setting NYC → LA also sets LA → NYC).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Lead times are saved bidirectionally. When you set the lead time from Warehouse A to Warehouse B, the same value is applied in both directions.
</Tip>

### Example Configuration

For a warehouse in New York, the lead time table might show:

| Destination Warehouse | Lead Time (Days) |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| LA Warehouse (LA-01)  | 5                |
| Chicago DC (CHI-01)   | 3                |
| Atlanta (ATL-01)      | 4                |

### Editing and Canceling

When you modify a lead time value:

- The **previous value** is displayed alongside the new value with an arrow indicator
- Click **Update** to save the change
- Click **Cancel** to revert to the previous value
- Changes also auto-save when you click away from the input field (if the value changed)

## Supplier Lead Times

Supplier lead times are configured per SKU in the supplier's capabilities table, not in the warehouse lead time settings.

### Where to Configure

1. Navigate to a **Supplier** detail page
2. The **Overview** tab contains the capabilities table
3. The **Lead Time (days)** column shows the production/delivery lead time for each SKU

### Per-SKU Lead Times

Each SKU-supplier combination can have its own lead time, reflecting:

- Manufacturing time for that specific product
- Shipping time from the supplier
- Any processing or customs time

See [Suppliers](/inventory/suppliers) for details on configuring supplier capabilities.

### Linked Warehouse Lead Times

If a supplier has a **linked warehouse** (Supplier Held Inventory), the supplier's **Lead Times** tab shows the same transit lead time configuration as a warehouse Overview tab, allowing you to configure transit times from the supplier's linked warehouse to your other warehouses.

## Lead Times and Supply Planning

Lead times directly impact supply recommendations:

### How Tether Uses Lead Times

1. **Calculates order timing** — When to place orders so they arrive before a stockout or safety stock breach
2. **Projects inventory** — When incoming stock will be available at the destination
3. **Generates alerts** — Warns when current inventory coverage is shorter than the lead time
4. **Forecast visualization** — Shows lead time periods in the forecast replenishment rows

### Example Calculation

```
Stockout projected: March 15
Transfer lead time: 5 days
Order should be placed by: March 10
```

If coverage drops below lead time, you'll see an urgent alert on the Inventory Dashboard.

## Factors Affecting Lead Times

Consider these factors when setting lead times:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Distance** | Longer distance = longer transit |
| **Shipping Method** | Ground vs. air vs. expedited |
| **Carrier Reliability** | Add buffer for unreliable routes |
| **Processing Capacity** | Larger orders take longer to process |
| **Receiving Capacity** | Busy warehouses take longer to receive |
| **Seasonality** | Holiday periods may have delays |

## Buffer Time

Consider adding buffer to lead times:

### Why Add Buffer

- Account for unexpected delays
- Provide safety margin
- Handle variability in transit times

### How Much Buffer

| Situation | Suggested Buffer |
|-----------|------------------|
| Reliable routes | 0-1 days |
| Standard routes | 1-2 days |
| Unreliable routes | 2-3 days |
| International | 3-5 days |

### Example with Buffer

```
Actual transit time: 3 days
+ Buffer for variability: 1 day
= Configured lead time: 4 days
```

## Monitoring Lead Time Accuracy

Track actual vs. configured lead times:

### Review Process

1. Check transaction history for actual delivery times
2. Compare to configured lead times
3. Adjust if consistently off

### Signs of Incorrect Lead Times

- Frequent stockouts despite orders in transit
- Inventory arriving earlier/later than projected
- Alerts don't align with actual urgency

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Conservative">
    When uncertain, use longer lead times:
    - Orders arrive early = extra safety stock
    - Orders arrive late = potential stockout
    - Better to have buffer than shortfall
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Regularly">
    Update lead times periodically:
    - Seasonal changes (holiday delays)
    - New shipping contracts
    - Route changes
    - Performance trends
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Assumptions">
    Keep notes on lead time configurations:
    - What components are included
    - What buffer is added
    - Why certain routes are longer
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider Variability">
    For routes with high variability:
    - Use the longer end of the range
    - Consider expedited shipping for urgent orders
    - Monitor closely during peak periods
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Orders Always Late

**Possible causes:**
- Lead time configured too short
- Not accounting for all components (processing, customs, receiving)
- Carrier performance degraded

**Solutions:**
1. Review actual transit times from transaction history
2. Add appropriate buffer
3. Consider faster shipping methods

### Orders Always Early

**Possible causes:**
- Lead time configured too long
- Carrier improved performance

**Solutions:**
1. If consistently early, reduce lead time slightly
2. Early arrivals are usually acceptable
3. Don't over-correct — keep some buffer

### No Other Warehouses Showing

**Possible cause:**
- Only one warehouse exists in the system

**Solution:**
Create additional warehouses to configure lead times between them.
