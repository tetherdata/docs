# User Roles & Permissions

Tether uses role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users have appropriate access to features and data. This guide explains the different roles and their capabilities.

## Available Roles

- External partners who need limited access

## Channel Access Rules

Beyond roles, Admins can configure granular channel access to control which data users can see.

### How Channel Access Works

1. **Admin creates access rules** in Settings (via user menu) → User Access
2. **Rules define** which channels and/or collections a user can access
3. **Sales Reps** see only data for their assigned channels
4. **Admins** always have access to all channels

### Example Access Configuration

| User | Role | Channel Access |
|------|------|----------------|
| Sarah | Admin | All channels |
| Mike | Sales Rep | Shopify US, Shopify CA |
| Lisa | Sales Rep | Amazon US |
| Tom | Sales Rep | Wholesale |

### Configuring Channel Access

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Click your **profile avatar** in the top-right corner, select **Settings**, then click the **User Access** card
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select User">
    Find the user in the list and click to edit
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Access Rules">
    - Select which channels the user can access
    - Optionally restrict to specific collections
    - Preview effective permissions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save** to apply the access rules
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Navigation Differences

### Admin Sidebar

Admins see the full navigation menu:

```
├── SKUs (Dimensions, Collections, Product Hierarchy, SKUs)
├── Inventory (Report, Warehouses, Suppliers)
├── Demand Forecast (Dashboard, Comparison, Admin, Sales History, Promotions, Edit Log)
├── Integrations (Data Ingestion)
├── Channels (Channel List, Hierarchy)
└── Transactions
```

<Info>
  **Settings** is accessed from the user menu (profile avatar) in the top-right corner, not the sidebar. Only Admins see the Settings option in their user menu.
</Info>

### Sales Rep Sidebar

Sales Reps see a simplified menu:

```
├── SKUs (Collections, SKUs)
├── Demand Forecast (Dashboard, Comparison, Sales History, Edit Log)
└── Channels (Channel List)
```

<Info>
  The navigation automatically adjusts based on the user's role. You'll only see menu items you have access to.
</Info>

## Best Practices

### Role Assignment

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Principle of Least Privilege" icon="shield-check">
    Assign the minimum role needed for each user's job function. Start with Sales Rep and upgrade to Admin only if needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Regular Review" icon="clock">
    Periodically review user roles and access to ensure they're still appropriate as team members change positions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Access Control Tips

1. **Document your access rules** - Keep a record of who has access to what and why
2. **Use channel access** - Even for Admins, consider using channel access to prevent accidental changes to unrelated data
3. **Onboard carefully** - When adding new users, start with restricted access and expand as needed

## Checking Your Access

To see your current role and permissions:

1. Click your **user avatar** in the top-right corner
2. Your role badge is displayed next to your name
3. The navigation menu shows only features you can access

## Need More Access?

If you need access to features you can't see:

1. Contact your Tether administrator
2. Explain what you need access to and why
3. They can adjust your role or channel access as appropriate
