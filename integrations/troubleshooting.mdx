# Integration Troubleshooting

This guide helps you identify and resolve common integration issues.

## Common Issues

### Authentication Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Sync execution fails immediately
- Error message referencing credentials or authentication
- No records fetched

**Causes:**
- Expired API access token
- Invalid credentials entered during setup
- Credentials revoked on the external platform
- Store URL changed or incorrect

**Solutions:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Credentials">
    Check that the credentials entered in Tether match what's configured in the external service
  </Step>

  <Step title="Regenerate Credentials">
    If using API keys or access tokens, generate new ones from the external platform's settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Recreate Integration">
    If credentials cannot be updated in place, delete the integration and create a new one with valid credentials
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check External Platform">
    Ensure the external platform account is active and the API access hasn't been revoked
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Unmapped SKUs

**Symptoms:**
- Sync executions complete but with many "Failed" sync items
- Error messages referencing unmapped or unrecognized SKU identifiers
- Aggregate error analysis shows a list of unmapped SKU IDs

**Causes:**
- SKUs in the external system don't have matching `external_id` values in Tether
- New products added to the external platform that haven't been set up in Tether
- Naming mismatches between systems

**Solutions:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Unmapped SKUs">
    Open the failed sync execution and check the error analysis section for the list of unmapped SKUs
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure SKU Mappings">
    For each unmapped SKU, ensure the corresponding Tether SKU has the correct `external_id` set to match the external system's identifier
  </Step>

  <Step title="Re-Sync">
    Trigger a manual sync to reprocess the previously failed records
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Unmapped Channels

**Symptoms:**
- Sync items fail with channel-related error messages
- Error analysis shows unmapped channel identifiers

**Causes:**
- The external system references channels that don't exist in Tether
- Channel names or IDs don't match between systems

**Solutions:**

1. Review the unmapped channel identifiers in the execution error analysis
2. Create the missing channels in Tether or map existing channels correctly
3. Trigger a manual sync to reprocess

### Data Not Syncing

**Symptoms:**
- No new sync executions appearing
- Records fetched count is zero
- Expected data not showing up in Tether

**Causes:**
- Integration is disabled
- Cron schedule not configured correctly
- No new data in the external system since last sync
- Credentials expired

**Solutions:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Integration Status">
    Verify the integration is enabled on the integration detail page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Schedule">
    Check the cron expression and timezone are correct. Verify the "Next Sync" time is reasonable.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Last Sync">
    Review the most recent execution — did it complete successfully?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Source Data">
    Confirm that new data exists in the external system within the expected date range
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger Manual Sync">
    Click **Trigger Sync** to force an immediate sync and check the results
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Partial Sync Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Execution completes but statistics show a mix of success and failed records
- Some sync items have "PartialMapped" status

**Causes:**
- Some records have mapping issues while others are fine
- External data contains inconsistencies
- Mixed valid and invalid records in the same batch

**Solutions:**

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Filter by Failed** | Use the sync items filter to show only failed records |
| **Review Errors** | Check individual error messages for patterns |
| **Fix Mappings** | Resolve the most common mapping issues first |
| **Re-Sync** | Trigger a manual sync after fixes |

## Platform-Specific Issues

### Shopify

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Rate limit exceeded** | Shopify GraphQL API has rate limits. Wait for the next scheduled sync, which will resume from where it left off |
| **Orders not syncing** | Verify the Admin API access token has the required read permissions for orders |
| **SKU mismatches** | Shopify SKUs are matched via external ID. Ensure Tether SKUs have the correct `external_id` set |
| **Only paid orders syncing** | By design, the Shopify integration filters orders by financial status (paid, partially refunded) |

### TrackStar (Warehouse Management)

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Inventory not updating** | Verify the integration has the "Warehouse Inventory" capability enabled |
| **Connection failed** | Check TrackStar API credentials are valid |
| **Missing warehouses** | Ensure warehouses are configured in both TrackStar and Tether |

### BigQuery / Redshift (Data Warehouses)

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Query errors** | Verify database connection credentials and permissions |
| **No data returned** | Check that the configured queries or tables contain data |
| **Schema changes** | If the source schema changed, review and update the integration configuration |

## Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Check Integration Status

1. Go to **Integrations** in the sidebar
2. Verify the integration is **Enabled**
3. Check the **Last Sync** and **Next Sync** times

### Step 2: Review Recent Executions

1. Click on the integration to open its detail page
2. Review the sync execution history
3. Look for failed executions or executions with high failure counts

### Step 3: Inspect Failed Execution

1. Click on a failed execution
2. Review the **Statistics** (success/failed/skipped counts)
3. Check if it was a **Dry Run** (dry runs don't save data)
4. Filter sync items by "Failed" status
5. Review error messages for patterns

### Step 4: Check Error Analysis

1. In the execution detail page, look at the aggregate error analysis
2. Note any unmapped SKUs or channels
3. Review the top error messages

### Step 5: Trigger Manual Sync

1. Go back to the integration detail page
2. Click **Trigger Sync**
3. Monitor the new execution for results

## Error Message Reference

| Error Pattern | Meaning | Action |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| **Unmapped SKU** | SKU from external system not found in Tether | Add `external_id` to the matching Tether SKU |
| **Unmapped Channel** | Channel identifier not recognized | Create or map the channel in Tether |
| **Authentication failed** | Invalid or expired credentials | Update credentials or recreate integration |
| **Rate limited** | Too many API requests | Wait for next scheduled sync |
| **Connection timeout** | Network or platform issue | Retry with manual sync |

## Recovery Procedures

### Reset Sync State

If sync data becomes corrupted or you need to re-import all data:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact Admin">
    Resetting sync state requires administrator access
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reset State">
    On the integration detail page, use the **Reset Sync State** action (admin only)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm">
    This will delete all execution history for the integration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Full Sync">
    The next sync will perform a full data fetch. Monitor it closely for any mapping errors.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Resetting sync state deletes all execution history and forces a full re-import. Use this only when necessary.
</Warning>

### After Extended Outage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Integration Status">
    Verify the integration is still enabled and credentials are valid
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Missed Period">
    Check the last successful sync date to understand what was missed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger Manual Sync">
    Run a manual sync to catch up on missed data
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Completeness">
    Check record counts and compare with the source system
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Dry Run Troubleshooting

If you're using dry run mode to test an integration:

- Sync executions are marked with a **Dry Run** badge
- No data is saved to Tether, so you can safely test mappings
- Review sync items to see which records would succeed or fail
- Fix any mapping issues before disabling dry run mode

## Preventing Issues

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Regular Monitoring">
    Check integrations regularly:
    - Review execution history for failures
    - Verify records are being fetched as expected
    - Check for increasing error counts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep Credentials Current">
    Maintain authentication:
    - Monitor for credential expiration
    - Use long-lived API tokens where possible
    - Document credential rotation procedures
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test with Dry Run">
    Before making changes:
    - Use dry run mode to validate configuration changes
