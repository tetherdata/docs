# Sync Sessions

Sync sessions (also called sync executions) represent individual data synchronization runs between Tether and your connected platforms. Monitor sync activity to ensure data stays current and identify issues.

## What is a Sync Session?

A sync session is a single execution of an integration's data synchronization:

- Tether connects to the external platform
- Data is fetched based on the integration's capabilities
- Individual records (sync items) are processed
- The session completes with a status and statistics

## Viewing Sync Sessions

### Accessing Sync History

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Integrations">
    Navigate to **Integrations** in the sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Integration">
    Click on the integration you want to inspect
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Execution History">
    The integration detail page shows a table of past sync executions
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Sync Execution List

Each sync execution in the list displays:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Status** | Visual badge showing the execution result |
| **Domain Type** | What type of data was synced (e.g., sales_orders, warehouse_inventory) |
| **Started At** | When the sync execution began |
| **Duration** | How long the sync took (in seconds) |
| **Records Fetched** | Number of records retrieved from the external system |
| **Statistics** | Breakdown of success, failed, and skipped record counts |

## Sync Types

### Scheduled Sync

Syncs that run automatically based on the integration's cron schedule:

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **When** | Based on the configured cron expression and timezone |
| **What** | Incremental data since last sync (new and modified records) |
| **Duration** | Varies based on data volume |
| **Use** | Regular ongoing synchronization |

### Manual Sync

User-triggered synchronization for immediate data fetch:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Integration Detail">
    Navigate to the integration's detail page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Trigger Sync">
    Click the **Trigger Sync** button to start an immediate sync
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    The new execution will appear in the execution history
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Full Re-Sync

After resetting sync state (admin only), the next sync performs a full data fetch:

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **When** | After an admin resets sync state |
| **What** | All available data from the external system |
| **Duration** | Longer (full data volume) |
| **Use** | Recovery, re-import after fixing mapping issues |

## Sync Execution Details

Click on a sync execution to see its detail page.

### Execution Summary

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Status** | Overall execution result |
| **Dry Run** | Whether this was a dry run (mapping validation only, no data saved) |
| **Duration** | Total execution time in seconds |
| **Records Fetched** | Total records retrieved from the external system |
| **Domain Type** | The data type that was synced |

### Statistics

Each execution tracks aggregate statistics:

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Success** | Records processed successfully |
| **Failed** | Records that encountered errors |
| **Skipped** | Records that were skipped (e.g., already up to date) |

### Sync Items

The execution detail page shows a table of individual sync items — the records that were processed during the sync. Each item shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sync Status** | Status badge for the individual record |
| **Error Message** | Error details if the record failed |
| **Fetched At** | When the record was retrieved |
| **Domain Type** | Data type of the record |
| **External ID** | Identifier from the external system |
| **Records** | Record count (for aggregate items) |

### Sync Item Statuses

Individual sync items can have the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Processing** | Record is currently being processed |
| **Success** | Record was processed successfully |
| **Failed** | Record encountered an error during processing |
| **Skipped** | Record was skipped (e.g., no changes detected) |
| **Mapped** | Record was successfully mapped to Tether entities |
| **PartialMapped** | Record was partially mapped (some fields could not be resolved) |

### Filtering Sync Items

The sync items table supports filtering to help you investigate specific issues:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Status** | Filter by sync item status (e.g., show only Failed items) |
| **Search** | Text search across sync item fields |
| **Domain Type** | Filter by data type |

## Error Analysis

### Unmapped SKU and Channel Errors

A common source of sync failures is unmapped SKUs or channels. The execution detail page provides aggregate error analysis:

- **Unique unmapped SKUs**: List of SKU identifiers from the external system that don't match any Tether SKU
- **Unique unmapped channels**: Channel identifiers that couldn't be resolved
- **Top errors**: Most frequently occurring error messages

This helps you quickly identify which mappings need to be configured before the data can sync successfully.

### Viewing Error Details

For aggregate sync items (items that represent batches of records), you can click to view the detailed error breakdown showing individual record errors within the batch.

## Monitoring Sync Health

### Key Indicators

| Indicator | Healthy | Needs Attention |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Execution Status** | Consistently successful | Repeated failures |
| **Failed Count** | 0 or very low | Increasing over time |
| **Records Fetched** | Consistent with expected volume | Sudden drop or zero |
| **Duration** | Within expected range | Significantly longer than usual |

### Checking Sync Schedule

From the integration detail page, verify:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Last Sync** | When the integration last executed |
| **Next Sync** | When the next scheduled execution will occur |
| **Schedule** | The cron expression and timezone |

If the last sync is older than expected based on the schedule, the integration may be disabled or experiencing issues.

## Managing Sync Issues

### Retrying After Failures

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Failed Execution">
    Click on the failed execution to see error details
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Sync Items">
    Filter sync items by "Failed" status to identify specific issues
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fix Root Cause">
    Address the underlying problem (e.g., add missing SKU mappings, fix credentials)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger Manual Sync">
    Go back to the integration detail page and click **Trigger Sync**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Sync Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Unmapped SKUs** | External SKU IDs don't match Tether SKUs | Configure SKU external ID mappings |
| **Unmapped Channels** | Channel identifiers not recognized | Verify channel configuration |
| **Authentication Failed** | Expired or invalid credentials | Update integration credentials |
| **No Records Fetched** | Date range issue or empty data source | Check integration configuration and source data |

## Dry Run Mode

When an integration runs in dry run mode, sync executions are marked with a **Dry Run** indicator. In dry run mode:

- Data is fetched and mapping is validated
- No data is actually saved to Tether
- You can review sync items to see what would be processed
- Useful for testing new integrations or debugging mapping issues

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Regularly">
    Check sync status routinely:
    - Review execution history after schedule changes
    - Investigate any increase in failed records
    - Verify records fetched counts are reasonable
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Investigate Errors Promptly">
    Don't let errors accumulate:
    - Check error details on failed executions
    - Resolve unmapped SKU/channel issues quickly
    - Use dry run mode to test fixes before enabling
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Filtering">
    When investigating issues:
    - Filter sync items by "Failed" status to focus on errors
    - Search for specific external IDs
    - Filter by domain type to isolate data categories
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reset When Needed">
    If sync state becomes corrupted:
    - Ask an admin to reset sync state
    - This forces a full re-sync on the next execution
    - Monitor the full sync carefully for errors
  </Accordion>
