# Integration Setup

Integrations connect Tether to your external systems, automatically syncing sales orders, inventory, products, and other data.

<Note>
  Integration setup requires Admin access. Contact your administrator if you need to set up integrations.
</Note>

## Why Integrate?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Automated Data Flow** | No manual data entry |
| **Scheduled Sync** | Data stays current with cron-based scheduling |
| **Reduced Errors** | Eliminate manual mistakes |
| **Time Savings** | Focus on analysis, not data entry |

## Supported External Services

Tether connects to external systems through the ingestion service. The following external services are currently supported:

| External Service | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Shopify** | E-commerce platform for sales orders and products |
| **BigQuery** | Google Cloud data warehouse for sales history and other data |
| **Redshift** | AWS data warehouse for sales history and other data |
| **TrackStar** | Warehouse management system for inventory data |
| **Brewman** | Brewery management system |

<Note>
  The available external services and their supported capabilities are loaded dynamically from the system metadata. New services may be added without requiring a documentation update.
</Note>

### Data Types (Capabilities)

Each external service supports a subset of the following data types that can be synced:

| Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Sales Orders** | Individual sales order records |
| **Sales History** | Aggregated historical sales data |
| **Pending Sales** | Orders not yet completed |

## Integration Configuration

### Schedule Settings

Integrations use cron expressions for scheduling with timezone support:

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Cron Expression** | Standard 6-field cron format | `0 0 0 * * *` (daily at midnight) |
| **Timezone** | IANA timezone for the schedule | `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`, `UTC` |

Common cron patterns:

| Schedule | Cron Expression |
|----------|----------------|
| Daily at midnight | `0 0 0 * * *` |
| Every 6 hours | `0 0 */6 * * *` |
| Every hour | `0 0 * * * *` |

### Capabilities

Capabilities define which data types the integration syncs. You can enable or disable individual capabilities from the integration detail page after creation.

### Dry Run Mode

Integrations can operate in **dry run mode**, which validates data mapping without saving any data to Tether. This is useful for:

- Verifying field mappings before going live
- Testing new integration configurations
- Debugging data quality issues

## Managing Integrations

### Integration Dashboard

The integrations dashboard shows all configured integrations with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Integration display name |
| **External Service** | The connected platform (e.g., Shopify, BigQuery) |
| **Status** | Enabled or disabled |
| **Last Sync** | When the integration last ran |
| **Next Sync** | When the next scheduled sync will occur |
| **Capabilities** | Which data types are configured |

### Integration Detail Page

Click on an integration to view its detail page, which includes:

- **Integration info**: Name, external service, enabled status, dry run mode
- **Schedule settings**: Cron expression and timezone (editable)
- **Capabilities**: List of enabled data types (editable)
- **Sync execution history**: Table of past sync runs with status, domain type, duration, and record counts

### Enabling / Disabling an Integration

Toggle the integration's enabled status from the integration detail page or the dashboard. Disabling an integration stops all scheduled syncs but preserves the configuration.

### Triggering a Manual Sync

From the integration detail page, click **Trigger Sync** to run an immediate sync outside the regular schedule.

### Resetting Sync State

<Warning>
  This action is only available to administrators. Resetting sync state deletes all execution history for the integration and forces the next sync to perform a full data fetch.
</Warning>

Use **Reset Sync State** when you need to re-import all data from scratch, such as after fixing a mapping issue.

### Deleting an Integration

To permanently remove an integration:

1. Navigate to the integration detail page
2. Click **Delete Integration**
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
  Deleting an integration removes all its configuration and sync history. Historical data already synced to Tether is preserved.
</Warning>

## Credential Management

Each external service defines its own credential fields. Credentials are entered during integration creation and stored securely.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Dynamic Fields** | Credential fields vary by service — the form adapts automatically |
| **Field Types** | Text fields, number fields, with labels and placeholders |
| **Required Fields** | Marked with an asterisk (*) in the form |
| **Security** | Credentials are stored securely and not displayed after creation |

## Integration Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Dry Run First">
    Before enabling a new integration for production use:
    - Run in dry run mode to validate mappings
    - Review the sync execution results for errors
    - Check for unmapped SKUs or channels
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Initial Syncs">
    After enabling:
    - Watch the first few sync executions
    - Verify data accuracy in Tether
    - Check for failed or skipped records
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Choose Appropriate Schedules">
    Set sync frequency based on your needs:
    - Daily syncs are sufficient for most sales data
    - More frequent syncs for real-time inventory needs
    - Consider API rate limits of the external service
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Review">
    Periodically check:
    - Sync execution history for failures
    - Credential validity
    - Data quality and completeness
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Multiple Integrations

### Managing Multiple Sources

You can create multiple integrations, even for the same external service:

- Each integration has its own schedule and capabilities
- Data flows to appropriate channels based on mapping
- All data is consolidated within Tether

### Integration Architecture Options

Tether supports different integration architectures depending on your needs:

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Individual Channel Integrations** | One integration per sales channel (e.g., one Shopify integration per store) |
| **Centralized ERP Integration** | A single ERP or data warehouse integration that provides all sales data |
| **Hybrid** | Combination of direct channel integrations and centralized data sources |

See [Sync Sessions](/integrations/sync-sessions) for details on monitoring your integrations.
