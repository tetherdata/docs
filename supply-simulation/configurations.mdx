# Simulation Configurations

Configure your supply simulation to match your business rules, safety stock policies, and planning requirements.

## Configuration Overview

Supply simulation uses multiple configuration sources:

| Configuration | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| **Safety Stock** | Minimum inventory levels |
| **Lead Times** | Transit and production times |
| **Fulfillment Mapping** | Which warehouses serve which channels |
| **Supplier Capabilities** | What suppliers can provide |

## Safety Stock Configuration

### What is Safety Stock?

Safety stock is buffer inventory to protect against:

- Demand variability
- Supply delays
- Forecast errors

### Setting Safety Stock

Configure at the SKU/warehouse level:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Inventory Settings">
    Go to **Settings** → **Inventory Forecast**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Safety Stock Section">
    Locate safety stock configuration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Values">
    Define safety stock by:
    - Fixed quantity
    - Days of coverage
    - Percentage of demand
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Apply configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Safety Stock Methods

| Method | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Fixed Quantity** | Specific unit count | Stable demand |
| **Days of Cover** | X days of average demand | Variable demand |
| **Percentage** | % of forecast period demand | Seasonal products |

### Example Configuration

| SKU | Warehouse | Method | Value |
|-----|-----------|--------|-------|
| SKU-001 | Main | Days of Cover | 14 days |
| SKU-002 | Main | Fixed | 500 units |
| SKU-003 | Regional | Percentage | 20% |

## Lead Time Configuration

### Types of Lead Times

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Supplier Lead Time** | Time from order to receipt |
| **Transit Lead Time** | Shipping time between locations |
| **Production Lead Time** | Manufacturing time |

### Configuring Lead Times

#### Supplier Lead Times

Set at the supplier capability level:

1. Go to **Inventory** → **Suppliers**
2. Select supplier
3. View/edit capabilities
4. Set lead time per SKU

#### Warehouse Lead Times

Configure transit times between warehouses:

1. Go to **Inventory** → **Warehouses**
2. Access Lead Times
3. Set matrix of warehouse-to-warehouse times

See [Lead Times](/inventory/warehouses/lead-times) for details.

## Fulfillment Mapping

### What is Fulfillment Mapping?

Defines which warehouses fulfill demand from which channels:

```
Channel: Shopify US → Fulfilled by: Main Warehouse
Channel: Amazon → Fulfilled by: Amazon FBA
Channel: Wholesale → Fulfilled by: Regional DC
```

### Configuring Fulfillment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Inventory Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings** → **Inventory Forecast**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Fulfillment Mapping">
    Locate the fulfillment configuration section
  </Step>

  <Step title="Map Channels to Warehouses">
    For each channel, select fulfilling warehouse(s)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Apply the mapping
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Multiple Fulfillment Options

A channel can be fulfilled by multiple warehouses:

| Channel | Primary | Secondary |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Website US | East DC | West DC |
| Website CA | Canada DC | East DC |

## Supplier Configuration

### Supplier Capabilities

Configure what each supplier can provide:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **SKUs** | Which products they supply |
| **Lead Time** | Days to receive |
| **Cost** | Unit cost |
| **MOQ** | Minimum order quantity |
| **Capacity** | Maximum order quantity |

### Setting Capabilities

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Suppliers">
    Navigate to **Inventory** → **Suppliers**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Supplier">
    Choose supplier to configure
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Capabilities">
    For each SKU they provide:
    - Set lead time
    - Set costs
    - Set MOQ/capacity
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Apply configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Simulation Parameters

### Time Horizon

Configure how far into the future to simulate:

| Setting | Typical Value | Use Case |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| **Short** | 30 days | Tactical planning |
| **Medium** | 90 days | Standard planning |
| **Long** | 180+ days | Strategic planning |

### Demand Source

Which forecast to use:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Selected Model** | Currently active forecast model |
| **Specific Model** | Choose a particular model |
| **Manual Override** | Use custom forecast data |

## Overstock Configuration

### What is Overstock?

Overstock threshold defines when inventory is excessive:

- Ties up capital
- Risk of obsolescence
- Storage costs

### Setting Overstock Thresholds

Configure overstock alerts:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Days of Cover** | Alert if > X days inventory |
| **Multiple of Target** | Alert if > X times safety stock |

## Configuration Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Conservative">
    Begin with higher safety stocks:
    - Learn demand patterns
    - Understand variability
    - Reduce gradually
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Segment by Risk">
    Different settings for different products:
    - Critical items: higher safety stock
    - Long lead time: higher buffer
    - Stable demand: lower buffer
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Regularly">
    Update configurations as business changes:
    - New suppliers
    - Changed lead times
    - Demand pattern shifts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Decisions">
    Keep records of why settings were chosen:
    - Helps future adjustments
    - Enables learning
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Configuration Impact

### How Settings Affect Results

| Configuration | Simulation Impact |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Higher Safety Stock** | Earlier reorder, more inventory |
| **Longer Lead Times** | Earlier order dates |
| **More Fulfillment Options** | Flexible sourcing recommendations |
| **Lower MOQ** | Smaller, more frequent orders |

### Testing Configuration Changes

Before applying configuration changes:

1. Run simulation with current settings
2. Note baseline results
3. Run with new settings
4. Compare differences
5. Validate makes sense

## Troubleshooting

### Orders Recommended Too Late

**Possible causes:**
- Lead times not configured
- Safety stock too low
- Missing supplier capabilities

**Solutions:**
1. Verify lead time configuration
2. Review safety stock settings
3. Check supplier setup

### Too Many Recommendations

**Possible causes:**
- Safety stock too high
- Overstock threshold too low
- Many small orders (low MOQ)

**Solutions:**
1. Review safety stock levels
2. Adjust overstock thresholds
3. Check MOQ settings
