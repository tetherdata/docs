# Running Simulations

Supply simulation helps you understand future inventory positions and optimize replenishment decisions. Run simulations to see projected stock levels, identify potential stockouts, and generate order recommendations.

<Note>
  Supply simulation uses your demand forecasts, current inventory, and lead times to project future states.
</Note>

## What is Supply Simulation?

Supply simulation models your supply chain forward in time:

| Input | How It's Used |
|-------|---------------|
| **Current Inventory** | Starting point |
| **Demand Forecasts** | Expected consumption |
| **Lead Times** | Time for orders to arrive |
| **Open Orders** | Planned replenishment |
| **Safety Stock** | Minimum stock levels |

## Accessing Supply Simulation

Navigate to **Inventory** → **Supply Simulation** in the sidebar.

### Simulation Dashboard

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Run Button** | Execute new simulation |
| **Date Range** | Simulation time horizon |
| **Results** | Projected inventory and alerts |
| **Charts** | Visual projections |

## Running a Simulation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Supply Simulation">
    Go to **Inventory** → **Supply Simulation**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Parameters">
    Set simulation options:
    - Start date (usually today)
    - End date (planning horizon)
    - Mode (baseline or what-if)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Run">
    Execute the simulation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Results">
    Examine projected inventory and recommendations
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Simulation Modes

### Baseline Mode

Standard simulation using current data:

- Uses existing demand forecasts
- Uses configured lead times
- Uses current inventory levels
- Generates standard recommendations

### What-If Mode

Scenario analysis with modified parameters:

- Adjust demand multipliers
- Modify lead times
- Test supplier constraints
- Compare against baseline

See [What-If Scenarios](/supply-simulation/what-if) for details.

## Simulation Results

### Inventory Projections

For each SKU/warehouse combination:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Projected Quantity** | Expected inventory over time |
| **Stockout Date** | When inventory hits zero |
| **Coverage Days** | Days of inventory remaining |
| **Health Status** | Current inventory health |

### Health Status Categories

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Healthy** | Sufficient inventory |
| **Low Inventory** | Below safety stock threshold |
| **Out of Stock** | No inventory available |
| **Overstock** | Excess inventory |

### Order Recommendations

Simulation generates replenishment recommendations:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Type** | Purchase or Transfer |
| **Source** | Supplier or warehouse |
| **Destination** | Destination warehouse |
| **SKUs** | Products to order |
| **Quantities** | Recommended amounts |
| **Order Date** | When to place order |
| **Alert Level** | Urgency of order |

## Alert Levels

Recommendations are prioritized:

| Level | Description | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Urgent** | Stockout imminent | Order immediately |
| **Important** | Low inventory soon | Order this week |
| **Normal** | Standard replenishment | Schedule as planned |

## Using Simulation Results

### Review Recommendations

1. Check urgent alerts first
2. Review important recommendations
3. Examine normal orders for planning

### Create Orders

Convert recommendations to transactions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Recommendation">
    Choose an order recommendation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Details">
    Verify quantities and timing
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Draft">
    Convert to draft transaction
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit">
    Submit when ready to execute
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Bulk Operations

Create multiple orders at once:

1. Select multiple recommendations
2. Click **Create Drafts**
3. Review created transactions
4. Submit as needed

## Simulation Frequency

### When to Run

| Trigger | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| **Daily** | Routine planning |
| **After Forecast Update** | New demand data |
| **After Inventory Change** | Major stock movements |
| **Before Ordering** | Validate recommendations |

### Automatic Runs

Tether can run simulations automatically:

- Scheduled daily runs
- Results cached for quick access
- Alerts generated proactively

## Interpreting Results

### Projected vs. Recommended

| View | Shows |
|------|-------|
| **Current Projection** | What happens without action |
| **Recommended Projection** | What happens with recommendations |

### Reading the Timeline

1. **Blue line**: Current inventory projection
2. **Green line**: Projection with recommended orders
3. **Red zone**: Stockout periods
4. **Yellow zone**: Low inventory periods

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Run Regularly">
    Regular simulations catch issues early:
    - Run daily or weekly
    - Review results promptly
    - Act on urgent alerts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Before Ordering">
    Always simulate before major orders:
    - Validate quantities
    - Check timing
    - Identify conflicts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use What-If for Planning">
    Test scenarios before decisions:
    - Demand changes
    - Lead time variations
    - Supplier issues
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Accuracy">
    Track simulation accuracy:
    - Compare projections to actuals
    - Adjust parameters as needed
    - Improve forecast inputs
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Simulation Not Running

**Possible causes:**
- Missing data (forecasts, inventory)
- Configuration issues
- System processing

**Solutions:**
1. Verify forecasts exist
2. Check inventory data
3. Wait for processing to complete

### Unexpected Results

**Possible causes:**
- Outdated forecasts
- Incorrect lead times
- Missing open orders

**Solutions:**
1. Review input data
2. Update configurations
3. Verify open order status
