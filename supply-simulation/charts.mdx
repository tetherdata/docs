# Simulation Charts

Tether provides visual charts to help you understand simulation results, identify inventory issues, and make informed decisions.

## Chart Types

### Inventory Forecast Chart

The primary visualization showing projected inventory over time:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Blue Line** | Current inventory projection |
| **Green Line** | Projection with recommended orders |
| **Red Zone** | Stockout periods |
| **Yellow Zone** | Low inventory (below safety stock) |
| **Horizontal Lines** | Safety stock and overstock thresholds |

### Order Flow Diagram

Visualizes replenishment orders between suppliers and warehouses:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Nodes** | Suppliers and warehouses |
| **Arrows** | Order flow direction |
| **Labels** | Order quantities and dates |

## Reading the Inventory Chart

### Understanding the Timeline

The x-axis shows time from today forward:

```
Today -----> Future
  |           |
Start       End of
Date        Simulation
```

### Understanding Inventory Levels

The y-axis shows quantity:

```
Overstock ─────── Too much inventory
Target ─────────── Ideal level
Safety Stock ───── Minimum acceptable
Zero ──────────── Stockout
```

### Key Points to Identify

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Declining Line** | Inventory being consumed |
| **Sudden Drop** | Large order fulfilled |
| **Sudden Rise** | Replenishment received |
| **Flat at Zero** | Stockout period |
| **Line Crossing Safety Stock** | Low inventory alert |

## Chart Interactions

### Zooming

- Scroll to zoom in/out
- Click and drag to pan
- Double-click to reset

### Hovering

Hover over the chart to see:

- Date
- Projected quantity
- Demand for that day
- Orders arriving

### Filtering

Control what's displayed:

| Filter | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **SKU** | Show specific product |
| **Warehouse** | Show specific location |
| **Date Range** | Adjust time horizon |

## Chart Types in Detail

### Current Projection Chart

Shows what happens without any new orders:

**Use to understand:**
- When stockouts will occur
- How quickly inventory depletes
- Impact of current demand

### Recommended Projection Chart

Shows what happens with recommended orders:

**Use to understand:**
- Impact of recommendations
- Whether recommendations solve issues
- Timing of improvement

### Comparison View

Side-by-side or overlay comparison:

| View | Shows |
|------|-------|
| **Side by Side** | Two separate charts |
| **Overlay** | Both lines on same chart |

## Understanding Chart Patterns

### Healthy Inventory

```
          ───────────
         /           \
────────/             \────────
        ↑              ↑
     Restock        Restock
```

- Regular replenishment cycles
- Never hits zero
- Stays above safety stock

### Trending to Stockout

```
────────────
            \
             \
              \────────
               ↑
            Stockout!
```

- Declining without replenishment
- Will hit zero
- Needs urgent order

### Overstock Situation

```
────────────────────
                    Overstock threshold
      ─────────────
     /
────/
    ↑
 Large order
```

- Above optimal levels
- Ties up capital
- May need to reduce orders

## Using Charts for Decisions

### Identifying Issues

| Chart Signal | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| Crosses safety stock | Review recommendations |
| Reaches zero | Order immediately |
| Above overstock | Reduce planned orders |
| Erratic pattern | Review forecast accuracy |

### Validating Recommendations

Before accepting recommendations:

1. View the "with recommendations" chart
2. Verify issues are resolved
3. Check timing makes sense
4. Confirm no new issues created

### Communicating Status

Use charts to communicate:

- Share with stakeholders
- Include in reports
- Present in planning meetings

## Chart Customization

### Display Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Show Safety Stock** | Display threshold line |
| **Show Overstock** | Display upper threshold |
| **Show Orders** | Mark order arrival points |
| **Show Demand** | Overlay demand forecast |

### Time Scale Options

| Scale | View |
|-------|------|
| **Daily** | Day-by-day detail |
| **Weekly** | Aggregated by week |
| **Monthly** | High-level trend |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check Critical SKUs">
    Regularly review charts for:
    - High-value products
    - Long lead time items
    - Fast-moving SKUs
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compare Scenarios">
    Use charts to compare:
    - Current vs. recommended
    - Different what-if scenarios
    - Historical accuracy
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Share Visuals">
    Charts communicate better than numbers:
    - Export for presentations
    - Include in status updates
    - Use for alignment
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set Up Alerts">
    Don't rely only on charts:
    - Configure inventory alerts
    - Get notified of issues
    - Review charts for details
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Chart Not Loading

**Possible causes:**
- Simulation not complete
- No data for selection
- Browser issue

**Solutions:**
1. Wait for simulation to complete
2. Verify SKU/warehouse has data
3. Refresh the page

### Unexpected Pattern

**Possible causes:**
- Data quality issues
- Missing orders
- Configuration problems

**Solutions:**
1. Review underlying data
2. Check open orders
3. Verify settings
