# Simulation Charts

Tether provides visual charts to help you understand simulation results, identify inventory issues, and make informed decisions. The charts display the day-by-day output of the simulation engine, showing how inventory levels change over time as consumption and supply events occur.

## Inventory Forecast Chart

The primary visualization is the inventory forecast chart, which shows projected inventory levels over the simulation horizon for a specific SKU-warehouse pairing.

### Daily Inventory Values

The simulation tracks inventory on a day-by-day basis. The chart displays two key values for each day:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **BOH (Beginning on Hand)** | The inventory quantity at the start of the day, before any events are processed |
| **EOH (End on Hand)** | The inventory quantity at the end of the day, after all consumption and supply events are applied |

The relationship between BOH and EOH for each day follows this flow:

```
BOH → subtract consumption → add supply events → EOH
```

The next day's BOH equals the previous day's EOH, creating a continuous projection:

```
Day 1 EOH = Day 2 BOH
Day 2 EOH = Day 3 BOH
...and so on
```

<Tip>
The difference between BOH and EOH on any given day tells you the net inventory change. A large drop indicates high consumption or no incoming supply. A large increase indicates a replenishment order landing.
</Tip>

### Consumption Events

Consumption events reduce inventory throughout the simulation. These are shown on the chart as downward movements:

| Event Type | Description | Chart Effect |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Sales Forecast** | Projected daily sales based on the [demand forecast model](/demand-forecasting/algorithms) | Gradual, steady decline in inventory |
| **Actual Sales** | Recorded sales for historical days | Reflected in past-period inventory levels |
| **Transfer Out** | Inventory leaving the warehouse to supply another location | Sudden drop on transfer date |
| **Production Consumption** | Raw materials or components consumed during manufacturing | Reduction in component SKU inventory |

### Supply Events

Supply events increase inventory. These are shown on the chart as upward movements:

| Event Type | Description | Chart Effect |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Purchase Order Landing** | Inventory received from a supplier | Sudden rise on the landing date (order date + supplier lead time) |
| **Transfer In** | Inventory arriving from another warehouse | Sudden rise on arrival date (transfer date + transit lead time) |
| **Production Complete** | Finished goods added after manufacturing | Sudden rise on completion date (start date + production lead time) |
| **In-Progress Orders** | Existing orders (drafts or submitted) expected to arrive | Pre-scheduled supply shown on expected landing dates |

<Note>
The simulation distinguishes between two projection lines. The **current projection** (User Forecast Route) includes only existing orders and drafts from your supply plan. The **recommended projection** (System Forecast Route) includes system-generated replenishment orders based on your configuration rules.
</Note>

### Two Projection Lines

The chart displays two inventory projection lines:

| Line | Color | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Current Projection** | Blue solid line | What happens with your existing supply plan (current orders and drafts only) |
| **Recommended Projection** | Green dashed line | What happens if you accept the system's replenishment recommendations |

**Current Projection (User Forecast Route):**
- Uses existing supply plan drafts, submitted orders, and in-progress transactions
- Does **not** generate new replenishment orders
- Shows the impact of your current plan as-is

**Recommended Projection (System Forecast Route):**
- Ignores the user supply plan
- Generates new replenishment orders based on configured rules (cadence, safety stock, lead times, MOQ)
- Shows what the system recommends for optimal inventory levels

The gap between these two lines highlights where your current plan differs from the system's recommendations.

## Threshold Lines

The chart displays horizontal threshold lines that represent inventory targets and limits:

| Threshold | Visual | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Safety Stock** | Red dashed line | The minimum acceptable inventory level. When the projection crosses below this line, it indicates a safety stock breach. |
| **Target Stock** | Yellow dashed line | The ideal inventory level that replenishment orders aim to restore inventory to. |
| **Overstock Threshold** | Orange dashed line | The maximum desired inventory level. Inventory above this line is flagged as excess. |

### Reading Threshold Zones

The areas between threshold lines represent different inventory health states:

```
Above Overstock ──── Excess inventory (ties up capital)
─── Overstock Threshold ───
Healthy Zone ─────── Inventory between target and overstock
─── Target Stock ──────────
Adequate Zone ────── Inventory between safety stock and target
─── Safety Stock ──────────
Below Safety Stock ─ Risk of stockout (action needed)
─── Zero ──────────────────
Stockout ─────────── No inventory available
```

### Alert Levels

When inventory crosses threshold lines, the simulation assigns alert levels to replenishment recommendations:

| Alert Level | Condition | Recommended Action |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Urgent** | Inventory is at or below safety stock; stockout is imminent | Order immediately |
| **Important** | Inventory is approaching safety stock levels | Order this week |
| **None** | Inventory is healthy; standard replenishment scheduled | Follow normal cadence |

## Order Flow Diagram

The order flow diagram provides a visual representation of replenishment flows between entities in your supply chain.

### Diagram Structure

The flow diagram shows the movement of goods through your supply chain:

```
[Suppliers] ──Purchase Orders──→ [Warehouses] ──Transfers──→ [Warehouses] ──Fulfillment──→ [Channels]
```

### Diagram Elements

| Element | Shape | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Supplier** | Node (rectangle) | External vendors that provide inventory via purchase orders |
| **Warehouse** | Node (rectangle) | Inventory storage locations that receive, hold, and ship goods |
| **Channel** | Node (rectangle) | Sales destinations (e.g., Shopify, Amazon) that consume inventory |
| **Purchase Flow** | Arrow (supplier → warehouse) | Purchase orders from suppliers, showing quantity and expected dates |
| **Transfer Flow** | Arrow (warehouse → warehouse) | Inter-warehouse transfers, showing quantity and transit time |
| **Fulfillment Flow** | Arrow (warehouse → channel) | Demand consumption from channels |
| **Flow Volume** | Line thickness | Thicker lines indicate larger quantities being moved |

### Flow Information

Each flow line displays:

- **Direction** — where goods are moving from and to
- **Quantity** — number of units in the order or transfer
- **Timeline** — when the movement is expected to occur
- **Associated orders** — links to the underlying transactions

### Filtering the Flow

Focus the diagram on specific aspects:

| Filter | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **By Time Period** | View flows for the next 30, 60, or 90 days |
| **By Warehouse** | See flows to/from a specific warehouse |
| **By SKU** | Filter to a specific product across all locations |

## Understanding Chart Patterns

### Healthy Inventory Pattern

```
          ───────────
         /           \
────────/             \────────
        ↑              ↑
     Restock        Restock
```

- Regular replenishment cycles with smooth transitions
- Inventory stays above safety stock at all times
- Periodic rises (restocks) and gradual declines (consumption)

### Trending to Stockout

```
────────────
            \
             \
              \────────
               ↑
            Stockout!
```

- Continuous decline without replenishment
- Inventory will hit zero — needs urgent action
- Check for missing orders or insufficient supply

### Safety Stock Breach

```
────────────
            \        ┌───── Restock arrives
             \      /
- - - - - - -\- - /- - -  Safety stock line
               \/
```

- Inventory dips below safety stock before restock arrives
- The simulation may accelerate order dates to prevent this
- Consider increasing safety stock or shortening cadence

### Overstock Situation

```
────────────────────
                    Overstock threshold
      ─────────────
     /
────/
    ↑
 Large order (possibly due to MOQ)
```

- Inventory exceeds the overstock threshold
- Often caused by large MOQ requirements
- Consider negotiating lower MOQ or adjusting order timing

## Using Charts for Decisions

### Identifying Issues

| Chart Signal | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| Projection crosses below safety stock | Review and accept replenishment recommendations |
| Projection reaches zero | Place an urgent order immediately |
| Projection above overstock threshold | Reduce or defer planned orders |
| Large gap between current and recommended lines | Review system recommendations for improvement |
| Erratic pattern with sharp spikes | Review forecast accuracy and order timing |

### Validating Recommendations

Before accepting system recommendations:

1. View the **recommended projection** (green line)
2. Verify that safety stock breaches are resolved
3. Check that order timing makes sense given lead times
4. Confirm no new overstock issues are created
5. Review the events panel for order details

## Chart Customization

## Troubleshooting

### Chart Not Loading

**Possible causes:**
- Simulation has not been run or is still processing
- No data exists for the selected SKU-warehouse pairing
- Browser performance issue with large datasets

**Solutions:**
1. Wait for the simulation to complete before viewing charts
2. Verify the SKU-warehouse pairing has forecast data and configuration
3. Try refreshing the page or selecting a different pairing first

### Flat Line at Zero

**Possible causes:**
- No beginning inventory and no incoming supply
- All supply events are beyond the visible date range
- SKU-warehouse pairing has no demand forecast

**Solutions:**
1. Check that opening inventory is configured correctly
2. Extend the date range to see if supply events exist further out
3. Verify the demand forecast covers the simulation period

### Threshold Lines Not Showing

**Possible causes:**
- Safety stock or overstock thresholds not configured
- Display options have thresholds toggled off

**Solutions:**
1. Configure safety stock and overstock in [Simulation Configurations](/supply-simulation/configurations)
2. Check chart display options to ensure threshold lines are enabled
