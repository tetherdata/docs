## Metric Categories in Detail

### Forecast Accuracy Metrics

Understanding forecast performance:

#### MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

Measures average forecast error:

| MAPE | Interpretation |
|------|----------------|
| < 10% | Excellent |
| 10-20% | Good |
| 20-30% | Fair |
| > 30% | Needs improvement |

#### Forecast Bias

Shows systematic error direction:

| Bias | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Positive** | Over-forecasting | May have excess inventory |
| **Negative** | Under-forecasting | Risk of stockouts |
| **Near Zero** | Balanced | Good model fit |

#### Weighted MAPE

Weighted by sales volume—larger products count more:

- Better reflects business impact
- High-volume items weighted appropriately
- Use for overall accuracy assessment

### Inventory Health Metrics

#### Coverage Days

Days of inventory remaining at current consumption:

| Coverage | Status |
|----------|--------|
| < 7 days | Critical - order urgently |
| 7-14 days | Low - order soon |
| 14-60 days | Healthy |
| > 90 days | Overstock risk |

#### Inventory Turns

How many times inventory cycles per year:

| Turns | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| < 2 | Slow moving |
| 2-4 | Average |
| 4-8 | Good |
| > 8 | Fast moving |

#### Fill Rate

Percentage of demand fulfilled from stock:

| Fill Rate | Service Level |
|-----------|---------------|
| > 98% | Excellent |
| 95-98% | Good |
| 90-95% | Acceptable |
| < 90% | Needs improvement |

### Time Periods

Metrics can be viewed by:

- Daily
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Quarterly
- Yearly

### Aggregation Levels

Roll up or drill down:

|--------|------------------|
| **Low Coverage** | Order more inventory |
| **High MAPE** | Review forecast model |
| **Low Fill Rate** | Increase safety stock |
| **High Turns** | Maintain current levels |
| **Positive Bias** | Adjust forecasts down |

### Connecting Metrics to Actions

1. **Observe** - Track metric values
2. **Analyze** - Understand why
3. **Decide** - Choose action
4. **Act** - Implement change
5. **Measure** - Track impact

## Troubleshooting

### Metrics Not Updating

**Possible causes:**
- Data sync delay
- Filter excluding data
