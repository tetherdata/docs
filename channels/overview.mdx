# Channels Overview

Channels represent where you sell your products. Tether allows you to manage multiple sales channels, track performance by channel, and configure channel-specific settings.

## What is a Channel?

A channel is a sales avenue for your products. Each channel has a name, a type, a currency, and an active/inactive status. Channels are the foundation for organizing sales orders, demand forecasting, and performance analysis.

<Note>
  Currently, Shopify is the only supported channel type. Additional channel types will be added in future releases.
</Note>

## Why Track Channels?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Demand Forecasting** | Forecast by channel for accuracy |
| **Inventory Allocation** | Know where demand comes from |
| **Performance Analysis** | Compare channel performance |
| **Hierarchy Organization** | Group channels for reporting |
| **User Access** | Control who sees what data |

## The Channels Dashboard

Navigate to **Channels** in the sidebar to view the channels dashboard.

### Summary Cards

The dashboard displays three summary cards at the top:

| Card | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Total Channels** | Count of all configured sales channels |
| **Active Channels** | Count of channels currently accepting orders |
| **Channel Types** | Count of distinct channel types in use |

### Channels Table

The main table displays your channels with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Channel display name (links to detail page) |
| **Currency** | Channel currency (e.g., USD) |
| **Hierarchy Fields** | Dynamic columns for each active hierarchy field |
| **Actions** | Archive button to deactivate a channel |

Hierarchy field values can be assigned directly from the table using inline dropdown selectors. See [Channel Hierarchy](/channels/hierarchy) for details.

## Creating a Channel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Channels">
    Go to **Channels** in the sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Add Channel">
    Click the **Add Channel** button in the top right
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Details">
    Fill in the channel creation form:

    | Field | Required | Description |
    |-------|----------|-------------|
    | **Channel Name** | Yes | A descriptive name (e.g., "Shopify US", "Amazon Store") |
    | **Channel Type** | Yes | Currently only Shopify is available |
    | **Currency** | Yes | Currently only USD is supported |
    | **Active Channel** | No | Toggle to set initial active status (defaults to on) |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create">
    Click **Create Channel** to add the channel
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Channel Status

Channels have an active or inactive status controlled by the `is_active` flag:

| Status | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Active** | Channel is visible in active lists, available for orders and forecasting |
| **Inactive (Archived)** | Channel is hidden from active use, historical data is preserved |

You can archive a channel from the channels table by clicking the delete icon and confirming the action. Archiving sets the channel to inactive but preserves all historical data.

## Channel Detail Page

Click on a channel name in the table to open its detail page. The detail page shows:

- **Channel header** with the channel name, type badge, currency badge, and active status
- **Summary cards** showing total orders, manual orders, and integration orders
- **Sales orders table** listing all orders for that channel with columns for order number, source (Manual or Integration), order date, warehouse, external ID, and creation date

You can also create a manual sales order directly from the channel detail page by clicking **Create Manual Order**.

## Channels and Forecasting

Channels are essential for demand forecasting:

### Forecast by Channel

- Each SKU/channel combination can have its own forecast
- Different channels may have different demand patterns
- Promotions can be channel-specific

### Channel Performance

Track metrics per channel:

- Sales volume
- Forecast accuracy
- Growth trends

## Access Control

Channel pages require the **Sales Rep** role or higher:

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| **Admin** | All channels and settings |
| **Sales Rep** | Channel dashboard, detail pages, and hierarchy |

See [User Access](/administration/user-access) for configuration.
