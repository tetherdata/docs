    Navigate to **Settings** → **Inventory Forecast**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Fulfillment Mapping">
    Locate the fulfillment configuration section
  </Step>

  <Step title="Map Channel to Warehouse">
    Select which warehouse(s) fulfill this channel
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Apply the configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>

### SKU Availability

Control which products are available on the channel:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **All SKUs** | Every active SKU available |
| **Collection-Based** | Specific collections only |
| **Individual** | Hand-picked SKUs |

### Channel-Specific Pricing

If pricing varies by channel:

1. Go to SKU or Collection pricing
2. Add channel-specific prices
3. Default price used if no override

## Archiving Channels

To hide a channel without deleting data:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Channel">
    Navigate to the channel detail page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Change Status">
    Set Status to **Archived**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm the archive action
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Effects of archiving:**

- Channel hidden from active lists
- Historical data preserved
- Forecasts excluded from active views
- Can be restored later

### Restoring Archived Channels

1. Filter channels to show Archived
2. Open the archived channel
3. Change Status to **Active**
4. Save

## Channel Integration

For automated channels, configure integrations:

### Integrated Channels

| Integration Type | Examples |
|-----------------|----------|
| **E-commerce** | Shopify, WooCommerce |
| **Marketplace** | Amazon, eBay |
| **ERP** | NetSuite, SAP |

### Integration Settings

1. Go to **Integrations**
2. Create integration for the channel
3. Map fields appropriately
4. Configure sync settings

See [Integrations](/integrations/setup) for details.

## Channel Metrics

Track channel performance:

### Available Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sales Volume** | Units sold |
| **Revenue** | Sales value |
| **Forecast Accuracy** | How accurate forecasts are |
| **Growth Rate** | Period-over-period change |

### Accessing Metrics

1. Go to **Analytics** → **Metrics**
2. Filter by channel
3. Select time period
4. View channel-specific data

## Multi-Channel Considerations

### Channel Overlap

When selling same products on multiple channels:

- Inventory allocated across channels
- Forecast separately per channel
- Monitor for cannibalization

### Channel Prioritization

Configure priority for inventory allocation:

| Priority | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Equal** | Inventory shared proportionally |
| **Ranked** | Higher priority channels served first |
| **Reserved** | Specific inventory reserved per channel |
