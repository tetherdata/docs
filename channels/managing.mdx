# Managing Channels

This guide covers channel configuration and maintenance tasks.

## Channel Detail View

Click on a channel name from the channels table to open its detail page.

### Channel Header

The detail page header shows:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Channel Name** | Display name with a store icon |
| **Type Badge** | The channel type (e.g., Shopify) |
| **Currency Badge** | The channel's currency (e.g., USD) |
| **Status Badge** | Shows "Inactive" if the channel is not active |

### Summary Cards

Three cards provide a quick overview:

| Card | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Total Orders** | Count of all sales orders for this channel |
| **Manual Orders** | Orders created manually in Tether |
| **Integration Orders** | Orders synced from an external integration |

### Sales Orders Table

The detail page includes a full sales orders table with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Order #** | Order number or truncated ID (links to order detail) |
| **Source** | "Manual" or "Integration" badge |
| **Order Date** | Date the order was placed |
| **Warehouse** | Fulfillment warehouse (links to warehouse detail) |
| **External ID** | External system identifier, if applicable |
| **Created** | When the order was created in Tether |

The table supports sorting, filtering, pagination, row grouping, and a sidebar for column management.

## Creating Manual Orders

From the channel detail page, click **Create Manual Order** to create a new sales order assigned to this channel. You will be taken to the manual order creation form with the channel pre-selected.

## Archiving Channels

To deactivate a channel without deleting its data:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Channels">
    Navigate to the **Channels** dashboard
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the Channel">
    Locate the channel in the table
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Archive">
    Click the trash icon in the **Actions** column
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm">
    In the confirmation dialog, click **Archive Channel** to proceed
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Effects of archiving:**

- Channel's `is_active` status is set to false
- Channel is hidden from active channel lists
- Historical data (orders, forecasts) is preserved
- Channel can be identified in the system for future restoration

<Note>
  Archiving is a soft delete. The channel and all associated data remain in the system.
</Note>

## Channel Integration

Channels can receive orders automatically through integrations. When an integration syncs sales orders, each order is associated with a specific channel.

### Supported External Services

Integrations are configured separately and can sync data to your channels:

| External Service | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Shopify** | E-commerce platform integration |
| **BigQuery** | Data warehouse integration |
| **Redshift** | Data warehouse integration |
| **TrackStar** | Warehouse management integration |
| **Brewman** | Brewery management integration |

### Setting Up Channel Integrations

1. Go to **Integrations** in the sidebar
2. Create a new integration for the desired external service
3. Configure capabilities (e.g., sales orders, sales history)
4. Set up the sync schedule

See [Integration Setup](/integrations/setup) for detailed instructions.

## Channel Hierarchy Assignment

Hierarchy field values can be assigned to channels directly from the channels table on the dashboard. Each active hierarchy field appears as a column with a dropdown selector.

See [Channel Hierarchy](/channels/hierarchy) for configuration details.

## Multi-Channel Considerations

### Channel Overlap

When selling same products on multiple channels:

- Inventory is considered across channels for forecasting
- Forecast separately per channel
- Monitor for cannibalization

### Order Source Tracking

Each sales order tracks its source:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Manual** | Orders created directly in Tether |
| **Integration** | Orders synced from an external platform |

## Troubleshooting

### Channel Not Showing in Forecasts

**Possible causes:**
- Channel is archived (inactive)
- No sales orders on the channel
- Forecast filters excluding the channel

**Solutions:**
1. Check the channel's active status
2. Verify sales orders exist for the channel
3. Clear forecast filters

### Data Not Syncing

**For integrated channels:**
- Check that the integration is enabled
- Verify credentials are valid
- Review sync execution history

See [Integration Troubleshooting](/integrations/troubleshooting).
