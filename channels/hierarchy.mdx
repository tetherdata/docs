# Channel Hierarchy

Channel hierarchy lets you organize channels using configurable classification fields for better reporting and analysis.

## What is Channel Hierarchy?

Channel hierarchy in Tether uses **up to 5 independent classification fields** that you can label and populate with values. Each channel can be assigned a value for each field, enabling flexible grouping and filtering.

<Note>
  Hierarchy fields are flat dimensions, not a nested tree. Each field is independent — for example, you might have "Region" as Field 1 and "Business Model" as Field 2, and assign values to each independently per channel.
</Note>

### Example Configuration

| Field | Custom Label | Available Values |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Field 1 | Business Model | DTC, Marketplace, Wholesale |
| Field 2 | Region | North America, Europe, Asia Pacific |
| Field 3 | Platform | Shopify, Amazon, Manual |

With this configuration, a channel like "Shopify US" might be assigned:
- **Business Model**: DTC
- **Region**: North America
- **Platform**: Shopify

## Why Use Channel Hierarchy?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Reporting** | Aggregate data by any hierarchy field |
| **Filtering** | Filter by field values instead of individual channels |
| **Organization** | Logical grouping for navigation and analysis |
| **Flexibility** | Up to 5 independent dimensions to classify channels |

## Configuring Channel Hierarchy

### Accessing Configuration

Navigate to **Channels** → **Hierarchy** to open the hierarchy configuration dashboard.

### Setting Up Hierarchy Fields

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Field Labels">
    For each of the 5 available fields, set a custom label that describes what the field represents:

    | Field | Example Label |
    |-------|--------------|
    | Field 1 | Business Model |
    | Field 2 | Region |
    | Field 3 | Platform |
    | Field 4 | Account Manager |
    | Field 5 | Priority |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Activate Fields">
    Toggle each field to active or inactive. Only active fields appear as columns in the channels table.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Available Values">
    For each active field, define the list of available values. For example:

    **Business Model:**
    - Direct to Consumer
    - Marketplace
    - Wholesale
    - Retail

    **Region:**
    - North America
    - Europe
    - Asia Pacific
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Apply the hierarchy configuration. Changes will be reflected immediately in the channels table.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Assigning Channels to Hierarchy Values

Hierarchy values are assigned to channels directly from the **Channels** dashboard table:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Channels Dashboard">
    Navigate to **Channels** in the sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Hierarchy Columns">
    Active hierarchy fields appear as columns in the channels table (e.g., "Business Model", "Region")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Values">
    Use the inline dropdown selector in each hierarchy column to assign a value for that channel
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Hierarchy assignments are saved automatically when you select a value from the dropdown.
</Note>

## Using Channel Hierarchy

### Filtering by Hierarchy

In forecasts and reports, use hierarchy field values to filter:

- Filter all "DTC" channels at once
- Compare "North America" vs "Europe" performance
- View data for a specific platform across all regions

### Reporting with Hierarchy Fields

| Dimension | Example Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Business Model** | Compare DTC vs Marketplace vs Wholesale revenue |
| **Region** | Analyze geographic performance differences |
| **Platform** | Track orders by platform type |

## Common Hierarchy Patterns

### By Business Model

| Field Label | Values |
|------------|--------|
| Business Model | DTC, Marketplace, Wholesale, Retail |

### By Geography

| Field Label | Values |
|------------|--------|
| Region | North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America |

### Combined Approach

Use multiple fields together:

| Field | Label | Values |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Field 1 | Business Model | DTC, Marketplace, Wholesale |
| Field 2 | Region | North America, Europe, Asia Pacific |
| Field 3 | Platform | Shopify, Amazon, Manual |

This lets you answer questions like "How are DTC channels performing in North America?" by filtering on both dimensions simultaneously.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Match Business Structure">
    Design hierarchy fields to match how you manage the business:
    - How do you report performance?
    - How are teams organized?
    - What comparisons are meaningful?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep It Simple">
    Don't over-engineer:
    - Start with 2-3 active fields
    - Add more fields only when needed
    - Use clear, descriptive labels
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consistent Values">
    Use consistent value names:
    - Standardize terminology (e.g., always "DTC" not sometimes "Direct")
    - Keep values short but descriptive
    - Review values periodically for cleanup
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plan for Growth">
    Consider future needs:
    - New regions or business models?
    - Keep available values list manageable
    - You have up to 5 fields available
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Hierarchy Columns Not Showing in Table

**Possible causes:**
- Hierarchy fields are not set to active
- No fields have been configured yet

**Solutions:**
1. Go to **Channels** → **Hierarchy**
2. Ensure at least one field is toggled to active
3. Verify the field has a custom label set

### Channel Missing a Hierarchy Value

**Possible causes:**
- Value not yet assigned from the channels table
- The desired value hasn't been added to the field's available values

**Solutions:**
1. Go to the **Channels** dashboard
2. Find the channel in the table
3. Use the dropdown in the appropriate hierarchy column
4. If the value you need isn't listed, add it in the hierarchy configuration
