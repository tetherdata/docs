# Channel Hierarchy

Channel hierarchy lets you organize channels into logical groups for better reporting and analysis.

## What is Channel Hierarchy?

Channel hierarchy creates a tree structure for grouping channels:

```
All Channels
├── Direct to Consumer
│   ├── Shopify US
│   ├── Shopify CA
│   └── Website
├── Marketplaces
│   ├── Amazon US
│   ├── Amazon UK
│   └── eBay
└── Wholesale
    ├── Distributor A
    └── Distributor B
```

## Why Use Channel Hierarchy?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Reporting** | Aggregate data at any level |
| **Filtering** | Filter by category, not individual channels |
| **Organization** | Logical grouping for navigation |
| **Analysis** | Compare performance across groups |

## Configuring Channel Hierarchy

### Accessing Configuration

Navigate to **Channels** → **Hierarchy** (or through Settings).

### Setting Up Hierarchy Levels

Tether supports multiple hierarchy levels:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Level Names">
    Name each level:

    | Level | Example |
    |-------|---------|
    | Level 1 | Channel Type |
    | Level 2 | Region |
    | Level 3 | Specific Channel |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Values">
    Add values for each level:

    **Level 1 (Type):**
    - Direct to Consumer
    - Marketplace
    - Wholesale

    **Level 2 (Region):**
    - North America
    - Europe
    - Asia Pacific
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Relationships">
    Specify which Level 2 values belong under Level 1:
    - DTC → North America, Europe
    - Marketplace → North America, Europe, Asia Pacific
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Apply the hierarchy configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Assigning Channels to Hierarchy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Channel">
    Navigate to the channel detail page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Hierarchy Settings">
    Locate hierarchy assignment section
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Values">
    For each level, select the appropriate value:
    - Type: Marketplace
    - Region: North America
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Channel is now part of the hierarchy
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Channel Hierarchy

### Filtering by Hierarchy

In forecasts and reports:

1. Open the Channel filter
2. See hierarchy tree structure
3. Select at any level:
   - Select "Marketplace" to see all marketplace channels
   - Select "Amazon US" for just that channel

### Reporting at Different Levels

| Level | View |
|-------|------|
| **All Channels** | Total business |
| **Type** | DTC vs Marketplace vs Wholesale |
| **Region** | North America vs Europe |
| **Channel** | Individual channel detail |

### Drill-Down Analysis

Start high, drill down:

1. View total sales by Type
2. Click on "Marketplace" to expand
3. See breakdown by individual marketplace
4. Click on "Amazon US" for full detail

## Common Hierarchy Patterns

### By Business Model

```
Channel Type
├── Direct to Consumer
├── Wholesale / B2B
├── Marketplace
└── Retail
```

### By Geography

```
Region
├── North America
│   ├── United States
│   └── Canada
├── Europe
│   ├── UK
│   ├── Germany
│   └── France
└── Asia Pacific
    ├── Australia
    └── Japan
```

### By Platform

```
Platform
├── Shopify
│   ├── Shopify US
│   ├── Shopify CA
│   └── Shopify UK
├── Amazon
│   ├── Amazon US
│   └── Amazon UK
└── Custom
    └── B2B Portal
```

### Combined Approach

```
Type
├── DTC
│   ├── North America
│   │   ├── Shopify US
│   │   └── Shopify CA
│   └── Europe
│       └── Shopify UK
└── Marketplace
    ├── North America
    │   └── Amazon US
    └── Europe
        └── Amazon UK
```

## Hierarchy and User Access

Channel hierarchy works with access control:

- Grant access at any hierarchy level
- Access flows down to children
- Access to "Marketplace" = access to all marketplace channels

See [User Access](/administration/user-access).

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Match Business Structure">
    Design hierarchy to match how you manage the business:
    - How do you report performance?
    - How are teams organized?
    - What comparisons are meaningful?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep It Simple">
    Don't over-engineer:
    - 2-3 levels is usually enough
    - More levels = more complexity
    - Start simple, add as needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consistent Naming">
    Use clear, consistent names:
    - Obvious what each level means
    - Consistent terminology
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plan for Growth">
    Consider future needs:
    - New regions?
    - New channel types?
    - Build flexibility in
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Channel Not Appearing in Hierarchy

**Possible causes:**
- Hierarchy values not assigned
- Channel is archived
- Hierarchy not fully configured

**Solutions:**
1. Check channel's hierarchy assignments
2. Verify channel is active
3. Review hierarchy configuration

### Incorrect Totals

**Possible causes:**
- Channel assigned to wrong level
