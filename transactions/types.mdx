# Transaction Types

Tether supports three main transaction types, each serving a different purpose in your supply chain.

## Purchase Orders

Purchase orders are orders placed with external suppliers.

### When to Use

- Buying products from suppliers
- Replenishing inventory from external sources
- Ordering raw materials for production

### Key Information

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Supplier** | Who you're ordering from |
| **Destination Warehouse** | Where items will be received |
| **Line Items** | SKUs and quantities to order |
| **Unit Cost** | Price per unit |
| **Lead Time** | Expected delivery time |

### Purchase Order Workflow

```
Draft → Submitted → Confirmed → Shipped → Received → Completed
```

### Steps in a Purchase Order

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Order Placed** | PO sent to supplier |
| **Supplier Confirmed** | Supplier acknowledges order |
| **In Production** | Supplier manufacturing (if applicable) |
| **Shipped** | Items left supplier |
| **In Transit** | Items being transported |
| **Delivered** | Items arrived at warehouse |
| **Received** | Items inspected and stocked |

### Cost Tracking

Purchase orders track:

- Unit costs per SKU
- Shipping costs
- Duties and taxes (if applicable)
- Total order value

## Transfer Orders

Transfer orders move inventory between your warehouses.

### When to Use

- Rebalancing inventory across locations
- Sending stock to fulfill demand elsewhere
- Consolidating inventory
- Moving to a different storage location

### Key Information

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Source Warehouse** | Where items are coming from |
| **Destination Warehouse** | Where items are going |
| **Line Items** | SKUs and quantities to transfer |
| **Lead Time** | Transit time between locations |

### Transfer Order Workflow

```
Draft → Submitted → Picked → Shipped → In Transit → Received → Completed
```

### Steps in a Transfer Order

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Order Created** | Transfer initiated |
| **Pick Started** | Items being collected |
| **Picked** | Items collected from source |
| **Shipped** | Items left source warehouse |
| **In Transit** | Items being transported |
| **Delivered** | Items arrived at destination |
| **Received** | Items stocked at destination |

### Inventory Impact

Transfer orders affect inventory at both locations:

**Source Warehouse:**
- Committed when order created
- Deducted when shipped

**Destination Warehouse:**
- Incoming when in transit
- Available when received

## Production Orders

Production orders are for internal manufacturing.

### When to Use

- Manufacturing finished goods from components
- Assembling kits or bundles
- Converting raw materials
- Any internal production process

### Key Information

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Produced SKU** | What you're making |
| **Components** | Raw materials/parts needed |
| **Quantity** | How many to produce |
| **Warehouse** | Where production occurs |
| **BOM** | Bill of Materials defining inputs |

### Production Order Workflow

```
Draft → Submitted → Materials Allocated → In Production → QC → Completed
```

### Steps in a Production Order

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Order Created** | Production planned |
| **Materials Allocated** | Components reserved |
| **Materials Consumed** | Components pulled from inventory |
| **In Production** | Manufacturing in progress |
| **Quality Check** | Inspection of finished goods |
| **Completed** | Finished goods added to inventory |

### Inventory Impact

Production orders affect multiple SKUs:

**Components (consumed):**
- Reserved when allocated
- Deducted when consumed

**Finished Goods (produced):**
- Added when production completes

### Bill of Materials (BOM)

Production uses BOM to determine components:

```
Finished Good: T-Shirt Bundle (3-pack)
├── Blue T-Shirt M × 1
├── Blue T-Shirt L × 1
├── Blue T-Shirt XL × 1
└── Packaging Box × 1
```

## Comparing Transaction Types

| Aspect | Purchase Order | Transfer Order | Production Order |
|--------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| **External/Internal** | External (supplier) | Internal | Internal |
| **Cost Tracking** | Yes (supplier cost) | No (internal) | Yes (component cost) |
| **Source** | Supplier | Warehouse | Components |
| **Destination** | Warehouse | Warehouse | Warehouse |
| **Lead Time** | Supplier + shipping | Transit time | Production time |

## Choosing the Right Type

### Use Purchase Order When:

- Inventory comes from outside your organization
- You're paying an external supplier
- Items don't exist in your inventory yet

### Use Transfer Order When:

- Inventory already exists in your warehouses
- You need to move stock between locations
- No external purchase is needed

### Use Production Order When:

- You manufacture or assemble products
- Finished goods are made from components
- You need to track production costs
