# Transaction Types

Tether supports three main transaction types, each serving a different purpose in your supply chain.

## Purchase Orders

Purchase orders are orders placed with external suppliers.

### When to Use

- Buying products from suppliers
- Replenishing inventory from external sources
- Ordering raw materials for production

### Key Information

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Supplier** | Who you're ordering from |
| **Destination Warehouse** | Where items will be received |
| **Line Items** | SKUs and quantities to order |
| **Unit Cost** | Price per unit |
| **Lead Time** | Expected delivery time |

### Purchase Order Workflow

When a purchase order is submitted, Tether creates a **Purchase step** to track the supplier fulfillment, followed by a **Shipment step** when a Shipping Plan is created to move goods to your warehouse.

```
Draft → In Progress (Purchase Step: In Process → Completed Purchase)
                     → Shipment Step: In Transit → Completed Shipment
     → Completed
```

### Steps in a Purchase Order

| Step Type | Inventory States | What Happens |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Purchase** | In Process → Completed Purchase | Tracks supplier order progress. No warehouse inventory changes until shipment. When completed, inventory is added to sellable at the supplier's linked warehouse. |
| **Shipment** | In Transit → Completed Shipment | Created when a Shipping Plan artifact is submitted. Subtracts inventory from source, adds to "Awaiting In-Transit" at destination. On completion, moves to sellable at destination. |

### Cost Tracking

Purchase orders track costs through artifacts:

- Unit costs per SKU (on line items)
- Shipping and freight costs (artifact-level cost items)
- Duties, tariffs, and taxes (artifact-level cost items)
- Total order value

The **Analysis** tab shows planned vs. reported cost variance once the transaction is in progress.

## Transfer Orders

Transfer orders move inventory between your warehouses.

### When to Use

- Rebalancing inventory across locations
- Sending stock to fulfill demand elsewhere
- Consolidating inventory
- Moving to a different storage location

### Key Information

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Source Warehouse** | Where items are coming from |
| **Destination Warehouse** | Where items are going |
| **Line Items** | SKUs and quantities to transfer |
| **Lead Time** | Transit time between locations |

### Transfer Order Workflow

When a transfer order is submitted, Tether automatically creates a **Shipping Plan** artifact and a **Shipment step**. All inventory immediately enters the "In Transit" state—there are no intermediate picking steps.

```
Draft → Submitted (auto-creates Shipping Plan + Shipment Step)
     → In Progress (Shipment Step: In Transit → Completed Shipment)
     → Completed
```

<Note>
  Unlike purchase orders, transfer orders create a Shipping Plan automatically on submission. The full quantity immediately enters "In Transit" status.
</Note>

### Steps in a Transfer Order

| Step Type | Inventory States | What Happens |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Shipment** | In Transit → Completed Shipment | The only step type for transfers. On creation, subtracts inventory from source warehouse sellable and adds to "Awaiting In-Transit" at destination. On completion, moves to sellable at destination. |

### Inventory Impact

Transfer orders affect inventory at both locations immediately on submission:

**Source Warehouse:**
- Sellable inventory subtracted when submitted (enters In Transit)

**Destination Warehouse:**
- Added to "Awaiting In-Transit" when submitted
- Moved to sellable when shipment is completed

<Warning>
  If the source warehouse does not have sufficient sellable inventory at submission time, the submission is blocked with an error.
</Warning>

## Production Orders

Production orders are for internal manufacturing.

### When to Use

- Manufacturing finished goods from components
- Assembling kits or bundles
- Converting raw materials
- Any internal production process

### Key Information

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Produced SKU** | What you're making |
| **Components** | Raw materials/parts needed |
| **Quantity** | How many to produce |
| **Warehouse** | Where production occurs |
| **BOM** | Bill of Materials defining inputs |

### Production Order Workflow

When a production order is submitted, Tether creates a **Production step** that tracks both the finished goods being produced and the components being consumed.

```
Draft → In Progress (Production Step: In Production → Completed Production)
     → Completed
```

### Steps in a Production Order

| Step Type | Inventory States | What Happens |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Production** | In Production → Completed Production | Tracks manufacturing progress. Components are committed (subtracted from sellable) and consumed during production. Finished goods are added to sellable at the source warehouse on completion. |

**Component inventory states** (tracked within the production step):

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Committed** | Components reserved—subtracted from sellable at the supplier warehouse |
| **Consumed** | Components actually used in production |
| **Backordered** | Components that could not be committed due to insufficient inventory |

### Inventory Impact

Production orders affect multiple SKUs:

**Components (at supplier warehouse):**
- Subtracted from sellable and moved to Committed when production starts
- Moved from Committed to Consumed during production
- Marked as Backordered if insufficient inventory is available

**Finished Goods (produced):**
- Added to sellable at the source warehouse when production completes

### Bill of Materials (BOM)

Production uses BOM to determine components:

```
Finished Good: T-Shirt Bundle (3-pack)
├── Blue T-Shirt M × 1
├── Blue T-Shirt L × 1
├── Blue T-Shirt XL × 1
└── Poly Bag × 1 (Component)
```

## Comparing Transaction Types

| Aspect | Purchase Order | Transfer Order | Production Order |
|--------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| **External/Internal** | External (supplier) | Internal | Internal |
| **Cost Tracking** | Yes (supplier cost) | No (internal) | Yes (component cost) |
| **Source** | Supplier (resolved to warehouse) | Warehouse | Supplier |
| **Destination** | Warehouse | Warehouse | Warehouse |
| **Step Types** | Purchase + Shipment | Shipment only | Production |
| **Lead Time** | Supplier + shipping | Transit time | Production time |
| **Auto Shipping Plan** | No (created manually) | Yes (on submission) | No (created manually) |

## Choosing the Right Type

### Use Purchase Order When:

- Inventory comes from outside your organization
- You're paying an external supplier
- Items don't exist in your inventory yet

### Use Transfer Order When:

- Inventory already exists in your warehouses
- You need to move stock between locations
- No external purchase is needed

### Use Production Order When:

- You manufacture or assemble products
- Finished goods are made from components
- You need to track production costs
