# Transactions Overview

Transactions are the orders that flow through your supply chain—purchase orders from suppliers, transfers between warehouses, and production orders. Tether helps you create, track, and manage these transactions from creation to completion.

<Note>
  Transaction management is available to Admin users.
</Note>

## What is a Transaction?

A transaction represents an order or movement in your supply chain:

| Transaction Type | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Purchase Order** | Order sent to a supplier |
| **Transfer Order** | Movement between warehouses |
| **Production Order** | Internal manufacturing |

## The Transactions Dashboard

Navigate to **Transactions** in the sidebar to access the transactions dashboard.

### Dashboard Layout

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Transaction List** | All transactions with status and details |
| **Filters** | Narrow by status, type, date range |
| **Supply Plan Tab** | Scheduled and recommended orders |
| **Create Button** | Start new transactions |

### Transaction List Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Transaction identifier |
| **Type** | Purchase, Transfer, or Production |
| **Status** | Current state in workflow |
| **Source** | Supplier or source warehouse |
| **Destination** | Destination warehouse |
| **Order Date** | When order was/should be placed |
| **Line Items** | Number of SKUs |
| **Total** | Order value |

## Transaction Status

Transactions move through a lifecycle:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Created but not submitted—no steps exist yet |
| **In Progress** | Submitted and being processed—at least one step exists |
| **Completed** | All steps completed, inventory fully updated |
| **Archived** | Terminal state for historical records |

### Status Flow

```
Draft → In Progress → Completed → Archived
```

## Transaction Sources

### Creation Source

| Source | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **System Recommended** | Generated by Tether's replenishment engine based on inventory needs. Replaced automatically when forecasts are regenerated. |
| **User Created** | Manually created by a user, or converted from a system recommendation. These are never overwritten by the system. |

## Transaction Components

### Line Items

Each transaction contains line items specifying:

- SKU being ordered
- Quantity
- Unit cost (for purchase orders)
- Expected delivery date

### Steps

Each transaction contains steps that track workflow progress. Steps are typed based on the activity they represent:

| Step Type | Used For | Inventory States |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Purchase** | Tracking supplier purchase progress | In Process → Completed Purchase |
| **Production** | Tracking manufacturing progress | In Production → Completed Production |
| **Shipment** | Tracking movement from source to destination | In Transit → Completed Shipment |

Steps have their own statuses: **Draft**, **In Progress**, **Completed**, or **Cancelled**.

### Artifacts

Transactions use an artifact system for business documents. Each transaction has a **root artifact** that defines its type, plus additional artifacts created during the workflow:

| Artifact Type | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| **Purchase Order** | Root artifact for purchase transactions |
| **Production Order** | Root artifact for production transactions |
| **Shipping Plan** | Defines a shipment—creates a shipment step |
| **Production Report** | Updates production step progress |
| **Purchase Report** | Updates purchase step progress |
| **Shipment Receipt** | Updates shipment step progress |
| **Packing List** | Shipping documentation |
| **Quality Certificate** | Inspection documentation |

| **In Progress** | Limited—some fields locked |
| **Completed** | No—read only |

## Filtering Transactions

### By Status

Filter to see transactions in specific states:

- Drafts needing attention
- In-progress orders to track
- Completed for reference
- Archived for historical records

### By Type

Focus on specific transaction types:

- Only purchase orders
- Only transfers
- Only production

### By Date Range

View transactions within time periods:

- This week's orders
- This month
- Custom date range

### By Warehouse

See transactions for specific locations:

- Orders coming to a warehouse
- Transfers from a warehouse

## Transaction Alerts

Tether highlights transactions needing attention:

| Alert | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Urgent** | Needs immediate action |
| **Important** | Action needed soon |
| **Overdue** | Past expected date |
| **At Risk** | May miss expected date |

## Integration with Supply Plan

Transactions connect to the supply plan:

1. **Recommendations** appear in supply plan
2. **Create draft** converts to transaction
3. **Submit** starts transaction workflow
4. **Complete** updates inventory

See [Supply Plan](/inventory/supply-plan) for more on recommendations.
