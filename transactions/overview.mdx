# Transactions Overview

Transactions are the orders that flow through your supply chain—purchase orders from suppliers, transfers between warehouses, and production orders. Tether helps you create, track, and manage these transactions from creation to completion.

<Note>
  Transaction management is available to Admin users.

## What is a Transaction?

A transaction represents an order or movement in your supply chain:

| Transaction Type | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Purchase Order** | Order sent to a supplier |
| **Transfer Order** | Movement between warehouses |
| **Production Order** | Internal manufacturing |

## The Transactions Dashboard

Navigate to **Transactions** in the sidebar to access the transactions dashboard.

### Dashboard Layout

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Transaction List** | All transactions with status and details |
| **Filters** | Narrow by status, type, date range |
| **Supply Plan Tab** | Scheduled and recommended orders |
| **Create Button** | Start new transactions |

### Transaction List Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Transaction identifier |
| **Type** | Purchase, Transfer, or Production |
| **Status** | Current state in workflow |

## Transaction Status

Transactions move through a lifecycle:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Created but not submitted |
| **In Progress** | Submitted and being processed |
| **Completed** | Order fulfilled, inventory received |
| **Cancelled** | Order was cancelled |

### Status Flow

         ↓
      Cancelled
```

## Transaction Sources

### Creation Source

| Source | Meaning |
|--------|---------|

## Transaction Components

### Steps

Transactions may have multiple steps tracking the workflow:

| **Order Placed** | Order sent to supplier |
| **Order Confirmed** | Supplier confirms order |
| **Shipped** | Items in transit |
| **Received** | Items arrived at warehouse |

## Transaction Alerts

| **Important** | Action needed soon |
| **Overdue** | Past expected date |

## Integration with Supply Plan

Transactions connect to the supply plan:

1. **Recommendations** appear in supply plan
2. **Create draft** converts to transaction
3. **Submit** starts transaction workflow
4. **Complete** updates inventory

See [Supply Plan](/inventory/supply-plan) for more on recommendations.
