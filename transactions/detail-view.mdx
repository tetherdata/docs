# Transaction Detail View

The transaction detail view provides comprehensive information about a single transaction. This guide explains each tab and how to use them effectively.

## Accessing Transaction Details

Click on any transaction in the transactions list to open its detail view.

## Detail View Layout

The transaction detail page includes:

- **Header**: Name, status, type, and quick actions
- **Tabs**: Different aspects of the transaction
- **Action Buttons**: Status-appropriate actions

## Header Section

### Key Information

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Transaction Name** | Auto-generated or custom name |
| **Status Badge** | Current status (Draft, In Progress, etc.) |
| **Type Badge** | Purchase, Transfer, or Production |
| **Source/Supplier** | Where goods come from |
| **Destination** | Where goods are going |
| **Dates** | Key dates (order, expected, etc.) |

### Quick Actions

Available actions depend on status:

| Status | Available Actions |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Draft** | Edit, Submit, Delete |
| **In Progress** | Update Steps, Add Documents |
| **Completed** | View Only, Export, Archive |
| **Archived** | View Only |

## Tabs Overview

The detail view organizes information into tabs. Some tabs are only visible once the transaction leaves Draft status.

| Tab | Visibility | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| **Overview** | Always | General info, line items, and metadata |
| **Steps & Inventory** | Non-draft only | Step progress and inventory state per step |
| **Documents** | Always | Artifacts and uploaded documents |
| **Inventory Impact** | Always | How this transaction affects inventory levels |
| **Analysis** | Non-draft only | Cost variance and quantity analysis |

### Overview Tab

General transaction information and line items:

- **Basic Details**: Name, reference number, dates
- **Source/Destination**: Supplier or warehouse information
- **Line Items**: Products in the transaction with SKU, quantity, unit cost, and totals
- **Summary Metrics**: Total items, total value
- **Notes**: Any comments or instructions
- **Metadata**: Created date, created by, last modified

### Steps & Inventory Tab

<Note>
  This tab only appears once a transaction has been submitted (status is **In Progress** or later).
</Note>

Tracks the real-time progress of each step within the transaction. Steps correspond to the three step types: **Purchase**, **Shipment**, and **Production**.

#### Step List

Each step shows:
- **Step type** (Purchase, Shipment, or Production)
- **Status** (Draft, In Progress, Completed, or Cancelled)
- **Inventory state** for that step (e.g., In Process, In Transit, In Production)
- **Source and destination** warehouses or suppliers

#### Updating Steps via Artifacts

Steps are advanced by submitting step-modifying artifacts:

| Step Type | Artifact to Submit | Effect |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| **Purchase** | Purchase Report | Updates purchase step progress |
| **Shipment** | Shipment Receipt | Updates shipment step progress |
| **Production** | Production Report | Updates production step progress |

New steps can also be initiated by submitting a **Shipping Plan** artifact, which creates a new Shipment step.

### Documents Tab

Lists all artifacts associated with the transaction:

#### Artifact Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Purchase Order** | Root artifact for purchase transactions |
| **Production Order** | Root artifact for production transactions |
| **Sales Order** | Root artifact for sales transactions |
| **Shipping Plan** | Creates a shipment step when submitted |
| **Transaction Initiation** | Step-based transaction initiation |
| **Production Report** | Updates production step progress |
| **Purchase Report** | Updates purchase step progress |
| **Shipment Receipt** | Updates shipment step progress |
| **Receipt** | General receipt document |
| **Packing List** | Shipping documentation |
| **Quality Certificate** | Quality assurance documentation |
| **Stock Take Form** | Inventory count documentation |
| **Inventory Adjustment** | Inventory adjustment record |

Each artifact has a status (**Draft** or **Submitted**) and can be viewed or submitted from this tab.

### Inventory Impact Tab

Shows how this transaction affects inventory across warehouses:

- **Per-SKU impact**: How each line item affects sellable, committed, reserved, and in-transit quantities
- **Source warehouse**: Quantities being deducted or committed
- **Destination warehouse**: Quantities incoming or added

### Analysis Tab

<Note>
  This tab only appears once a transaction has been submitted (status is **In Progress** or later).
</Note>

Provides cost and quantity analytics with two sub-tabs:

#### Cost Variance

Compares expected vs. actual costs:
- **Planned cost** vs. **Actual cost** per line item
- **Variance** amount and percentage
- **Landed cost** breakdown (unit cost + shipping + duties/taxes)

#### Quantity Analysis

Compares expected vs. actual quantities:
- **Ordered** vs. **Received** quantities
- **Shortages** and **overages**
- **Completion percentage** per line item
