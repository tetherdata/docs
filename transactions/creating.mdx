# Creating Transactions

This guide walks you through creating each type of transaction in Tether, from drafts to submitted orders.

## Creating from Supply Plan

The easiest way to create transactions is from system recommendations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Supply Plan">
    Navigate to **Inventory** → **Supply Plan**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Recommendations">
    Look at system-recommended orders
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Draft">
    Click **Create Draft** on a recommendation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Submit">
    Review the pre-filled draft and submit
  </Step>
</Steps>

See [Supply Plan](/inventory/supply-plan) for details on working with recommendations.

## Creating Manually

### Creating a Purchase Order

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start New Transaction">
    Go to **Transactions** → Click **Create**. When prompted, select **Buy New Inventory**. This tells Tether you are purchasing from an external supplier.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Supplier">
    Choose the supplier for this order:
    - Use search to find supplier
    - See supplier's configured lead time
    - Review terms and conditions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Destination">
    Choose which warehouse will receive the order
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Line Items">
    Add products to order:

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **SKU** | Search and select product |
    | **Quantity** | How many to order |
    | **Unit Cost** | Price per unit (may auto-fill from supplier) |
    | **Expected Date** | When you expect delivery |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Totals">
    Check order summary:
    - Total units
    - Total cost
    - Expected delivery dates
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save or Submit">
    - **Save as Draft**: Keep for later review
    - **Submit**: Send order to processing
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Creating a Transfer Order

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start New Transaction">
    Go to **Transactions** → Click **Create**. When prompted, select **Move Inventory** (as opposed to "Buy New Inventory"). This tells Tether you are transferring existing inventory between warehouses rather than purchasing new stock.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Source Warehouse">
    Choose where inventory will come from:
    - Only warehouses are shown (not suppliers)
    - See available sellable inventory at each warehouse
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Destination Warehouse">
    Choose where inventory will go. Must be different from the source warehouse.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Line Items">
    Add products to transfer:

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **SKU** | Search and select product |
    | **Quantity** | How many to transfer |
    | **Available** | Shows sellable inventory at source |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Expected Dates">
    - **Ship Date**: When transfer will leave source
    - **Arrival Date**: When expected at destination
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save or Submit">
    Save as draft or submit to start transfer
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  You cannot transfer more than the available sellable inventory at the source warehouse. If the source has insufficient inventory, submission is blocked with an error.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Split shipments**: You can specify multiple destination warehouses for a single transaction and allocate quantities per line item for each destination. Tether creates separate shipment steps and artifacts for each destination.
</Tip>

### Creating a Production Order

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start New Transaction">
    Go to **Transactions** → Click **Create** → Select **Production Order**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Product to Produce">
    Choose the finished good to manufacture:
    - Must have a BOM configured
    - See component requirements
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Warehouse">
    Choose where production will occur
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Quantity">
    Enter how many units to produce:
    - System calculates component needs
    - Shows component availability
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Components">
    Verify component requirements:

    | Component | Qty Needed | Available | Status |
    |-----------|------------|-----------|--------|
    | Part A | 100 | 500 | ✓ OK |
    | Part B | 50 | 45 | ⚠ Short |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Dates">
    - **Start Date**: When production begins
    - **Completion Date**: Expected finish date
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save or Submit">
    Save as draft or submit to start production
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Working with Drafts

### What is a Draft?

A draft is a saved transaction that hasn't been submitted yet. Use drafts to:

- Prepare orders for review
- Build orders over time
- Get approval before submitting

### Editing Drafts

1. Go to **Transactions**
2. Filter to "Draft" status
3. Click on the draft to open
4. Make changes
5. Save or Submit

### Draft Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Edit** | Modify any field |
| **Submit** | Start order processing |
| **Delete** | Remove the draft |
| **Duplicate** | Copy to create similar order |

## Adding Line Items

### Individual Item Add

1. Click **Add Line Item**
2. Search for SKU
3. Enter quantity
4. Enter cost (for POs)
5. Set dates if different from header

### Bulk Add

For multiple items:

1. Click **Bulk Add**
2. Either:
   - Paste from spreadsheet
   - Import from file
   - Select from list
3. Review and confirm

### Line Item Fields

| Field | PO | Transfer | Production |
|-------|-----|----------|------------|
| SKU | ✓ | ✓ | Auto (from BOM) |
| Quantity | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Unit Cost | ✓ | - | - |
| Expected Date | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## Validation

Tether validates transactions before submission:

### Purchase Order Validation

| Check | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Supplier | Must be selected |
| Destination | Warehouse required |
| Line Items | At least one item |
| Quantities | Must be positive |

### Transfer Validation

| Check | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Source | Must be selected |
| Destination | Different from source |
| Availability | Sufficient inventory |
| Quantities | Positive and within available |

### Production Validation

| Check | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Product | Must have BOM |
| Components | All available |
| Warehouse | Must be selected |
| Quantity | Positive |

## Submitting Transactions

### What Happens on Submit

When you submit a transaction:

1. **Validation** runs (including inventory checks for transfers)
2. **Status** changes from Draft to "In Progress"
3. **Steps** are created based on transaction type:
   - **Purchase Order**: A Purchase step is created (In Process state)
   - **Transfer Order**: A Shipping Plan artifact and Shipment step are created automatically. All inventory immediately enters "In Transit"—source sellable is subtracted.
   - **Production Order**: A Production step is created. Components are committed (subtracted from sellable at the supplier warehouse).
4. **Inventory** is affected per the step types above
5. **Notifications** sent (if configured)

### Submit Options

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Submit** | Standard submission |
| **Submit & Create Another** | Submit and open new form |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Verify Before Submit">
    Always review before submitting:
    - Correct supplier/warehouse
    - Quantities are right
    - Costs are accurate
    - Dates are reasonable
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Drafts for Review">
    Create drafts when:
    - Order needs approval
    - Waiting for information
    - Building complex orders
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check Availability">
    For transfers and production:
    - Verify source inventory
    - Consider committed quantities
    - Plan for safety stock
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Special Instructions">
    Add notes for:
    - Supplier instructions
    - Shipping requirements
    - Special handling
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Issues

### Can't Submit - Validation Error

**Possible issues:**
- Missing required fields
- Invalid quantities
- Insufficient inventory (transfers)

**Solution:** Review error messages and fix highlighted fields

### Supplier Not Available

**Possible issues:**
- Supplier not configured for SKU
- Supplier is inactive

**Solution:** Check supplier capabilities in supplier settings

### Component Shortage

**For production orders:**
- Not enough components available
- Components committed to other orders

**Solution:** Create purchase orders for components first, or reduce production quantity
