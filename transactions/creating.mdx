    Navigate to **Inventory** → **Supply Plan**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Recommendations">
    Look at system-recommended orders
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Draft">
    Click **Create Draft** on a recommendation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Submit">
    Review the pre-filled draft and submit
  </Step>
</Steps>

See [Supply Plan](/inventory/supply-plan) for details on working with recommendations.

| **Submit** | Start order processing |
| **Delete** | Remove the draft |
| **Duplicate** | Copy to create similar order |

## Adding Line Items

## Submitting Transactions

### What Happens on Submit

When you submit a transaction:

1. **Validation** runs
2. **Status** changes to "In Progress"
3. **Inventory** is affected:
   - PO: No immediate impact
   - Transfer: Source inventory committed
   - Production: Components reserved
4. **Steps** are created
5. **Notifications** sent (if configured)

### Submit Options

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Submit** | Standard submission |
| **Submit & Create Another** | Submit and open new form |

## Best Practices

    - Correct supplier/warehouse
    - Quantities are right
    - Costs are accurate
    - Dates are reasonable
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Drafts for Review">
    Create drafts when:
    - Order needs approval
    - Waiting for information
    - Building complex orders
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check Availability">
    For transfers and production:
    - Verify source inventory
    - Consider committed quantities
    - Plan for safety stock
  </Accordion>

## Common Issues

### Can't Submit - Validation Error

**Possible issues:**
- Missing required fields
- Invalid quantities
- Insufficient inventory (transfers)

**Solution:** Review error messages and fix highlighted fields

### Supplier Not Available

**Possible issues:**
- Supplier not configured for SKU
- Supplier is inactive

**Solution:** Check supplier capabilities in supplier settings

### Component Shortage

**For production orders:**
- Not enough components available
- Components committed to other orders

**Solution:** Create purchase orders for components first, or reduce production quantity
