# Transaction Workflow

Transactions follow a structured workflow from creation to completion. Understanding this workflow helps you manage orders efficiently and keep your supply chain running smoothly.

## Workflow Overview

All transactions follow a similar lifecycle:

```
Creation → Draft → Submit → In Progress → Completed → Archived
```

<Note>
  There is no "Cancelled" status at the transaction level. Individual **steps** within a transaction can be cancelled, but the transaction itself moves through Draft → In Progress → Completed → Archived.
</Note>

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Creation

**What Happens:**
- Transaction is initiated
- Basic information entered
- Line items added

**Sources:**
| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Manual** | User creates from scratch |
| **Supply Plan** | Convert from recommendation |
| **Copy** | Duplicate existing transaction |

### Stage 2: Draft

**What Happens:**
- Transaction saved but not active
- Can be freely edited
- No inventory impact
- No external communication

**Available Actions:**
- Edit all fields
- Add/remove line items
- Change supplier/warehouse
- Submit
- Delete

### Stage 3: Submission

**What Happens:**
- Validation runs
- Status changes to "In Progress"
- Inventory effects begin
- Workflow steps created

**Validation Checks:**
| Check | Failure Action |
|-------|----------------|
| Required fields | Block submission |
| Quantity validation | Show error |
| Availability (transfers) | Block submission |
| Component availability (production) | Block or warn |

### Stage 4: In Progress

**What Happens:**
- Transaction is active
- Steps are tracked
- Inventory committed/reserved
- Documents can be added

**Status Updates:**
| Action | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| Step completion | Manual update |
| Partial receipt | Receiving action |
| Issues | Notes and flags |

### Stage 5: Completion

**What Happens:**
- All steps are completed
- Inventory fully updated
- Transaction status moves to "Completed"

**Completion Types:**
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Full** | All items received/completed as expected |
| **Partial** | Some items completed, remainder steps cancelled |

### Stage 6: Archived

**What Happens:**
- Transaction is moved to the "Archived" terminal state
- Becomes fully read-only
- Preserved for historical records and audit
- No further status changes are possible

## Workflow by Transaction Type

Tether uses three step types—**Purchase**, **Shipment**, and **Production**—to model all transaction workflows. Each step has its own status (Draft → In Progress → Completed, or Cancelled) and tracks inventory through specific inventory state types.

### Purchase Order Workflow

```
Draft
  ↓
Submitted → Purchase Step created (In Process)
  ↓
Purchase Report submitted → Purchase Step completed (Completed Purchase)
  ↓
Shipping Plan submitted → Shipment Step created (In Transit)
  ↓
Shipment Receipt submitted → Shipment Step completed (Completed Shipment)
  ↓
Completed
```

#### PO Steps & Inventory States

| Step Type | Inventory State | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Purchase** (In Progress) | In Process | Order is being processed by supplier |
| **Purchase** (Completed) | Completed Purchase | Supplier has fulfilled the order |
| **Shipment** (In Progress) | In Transit | Goods are in transit to destination |
| **Shipment** (Completed) | Completed Shipment | Goods received at destination warehouse; sellable inventory added |

### Transfer Order Workflow

```
Draft
  ↓
Submitted → Shipping Plan auto-created → Shipment Step created (In Transit)
  ↓
Shipment Receipt submitted → Shipment Step completed (Completed Shipment)
  ↓
Completed
```

#### Transfer Steps & Inventory States

| Step Type | Inventory State | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Shipment** (In Progress) | In Transit | Goods deducted from source sellable, in transit to destination |
| **Shipment** (Completed) | Completed Shipment | Goods received at destination; sellable inventory added |

<Tip>
  For split shipments with multiple destinations, Tether creates separate Shipment steps and artifacts for each destination warehouse.
</Tip>

### Production Order Workflow

```
Draft
  ↓
Submitted → Production Step created (In Production, components Committed)
  ↓
Production Report submitted → Production Step completed (Completed Production, components Consumed)
  ↓
Completed
```

#### Production Steps & Inventory States

| Step Type | Inventory State | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Production** (In Progress) | In Production | Finished goods are being produced |
| **Production** (In Progress) | Committed | Components reserved from sellable inventory |
| **Production** (In Progress) | Backordered | Components that couldn't be committed due to insufficient inventory |
| **Production** (Completed) | Completed Production | Finished goods added to sellable inventory |
| **Production** (Completed) | Consumed | Components fully deducted from inventory |

## Step Management

### Step Statuses

Each step within a transaction has its own status:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Step created but not yet active |
| **In Progress** | Step is actively being worked on |
| **Completed** | Step finished successfully |
| **Cancelled** | Step was cancelled (does not block transaction completion) |

### Updating Steps via Artifacts

Steps are advanced by submitting the appropriate artifact:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Transaction">
    Open the transaction detail view
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to Steps & Inventory Tab">
    Click on the **Steps & Inventory** tab (visible for non-draft transactions)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select the Step">
    Find the step you want to update
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit the Appropriate Artifact">
    Submit the matching artifact to advance the step:
    - **Production Report** → advances a Production step
    - **Purchase Report** → advances a Purchase step
    - **Shipment Receipt** → advances a Shipment step
    - **Shipping Plan** → creates a new Shipment step
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review">
    Step status updates and inventory states change accordingly
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step Details

Each step tracks:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Step Type** | Production, Purchase, or Shipment |
| **Status** | Draft, In Progress, Completed, or Cancelled |
| **Inventory States** | Current inventory impact of this step |
| **Source** | Where goods come from |
| **Destination** | Where goods are going |

## Handling Issues

### Delays

When steps take longer than expected:

1. Add notes explaining delay
2. Update expected completion dates
3. Communicate with stakeholders
4. Consider impact on inventory

### Partial Fulfillment

When not all quantities are received:

| Option | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Wait** | More expected to arrive |
| **Backorder** | Order remainder separately |
| **Close Short** | Accept partial, close transaction |

### Cancelling Steps

Individual steps can be cancelled without cancelling the entire transaction:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Impact">
    Understand what inventory effects will be reversed for this step
  </Step>

  <Step title="Cancel the Step">
    Mark the step as Cancelled
  </Step>

  <Step title="Inventory Adjusts">
    Committed or in-transit inventory associated with that step is released
  </Step>
</Steps>

**What Gets Reversed When a Step Is Cancelled:**
- Committed components are released back to sellable
- In-transit quantities are reversed
- The step moves to Cancelled status

<Note>
  The transaction itself does not have a "Cancelled" status. If all steps are cancelled or completed, the transaction moves to **Completed** and can then be **Archived**.
</Note>

## Inventory Effects by Step Type

Inventory changes are tracked through `StepInventoryStateType` values on each step:

### Purchase Steps

| State | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **In Process** | Order is being processed; no inventory change yet |
| **Completed Purchase** | Purchase fulfilled; goods ready for shipment to warehouse |

### Shipment Steps

| State | Source Warehouse | Destination Warehouse |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **In Transit** | Sellable reduced | In-transit quantity shown |
| **Completed Shipment** | — | Sellable inventory added |

### Production Steps

| State | Components | Finished Goods |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| **Committed** | Reserved from sellable | — |
| **Backordered** | Insufficient inventory flagged | — |
| **In Production** | — | Being produced |
| **Consumed** | Fully deducted | — |
| **Completed Production** | — | Added to sellable |

## Workflow Reporting

### Lead Time Analysis

Track actual vs. expected:
- Step durations
- Total order time
- Supplier performance
- Transit times

### Bottleneck Identification

Find where delays occur:
- Which steps take longest?
- Which suppliers are slow?
- Which warehouses are slow to receive?
