# Transaction Workflow

Transactions follow a structured workflow from creation to completion. Understanding this workflow helps you manage orders efficiently and keep your supply chain running smoothly.

## Workflow Overview

All transactions follow a similar lifecycle:

```
Creation → Draft → Submit → In Progress → Complete
                      ↓
                   Cancel
```

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Creation

**What Happens:**
- Transaction is initiated
- Basic information entered
- Line items added

**Sources:**
| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Manual** | User creates from scratch |
| **Supply Plan** | Convert from recommendation |
| **Copy** | Duplicate existing transaction |

### Stage 2: Draft

**What Happens:**
- Transaction saved but not active
- Can be freely edited
- No inventory impact
- No external communication

**Available Actions:**
- Edit all fields
- Add/remove line items
- Change supplier/warehouse
- Submit
- Delete

### Stage 3: Submission

**What Happens:**
- Validation runs
- Status changes to "In Progress"
- Inventory effects begin
- Workflow steps created

**Validation Checks:**
| Check | Failure Action |
|-------|----------------|
| Required fields | Block submission |
| Quantity validation | Show error |
| Availability (transfers) | Block submission |
| Component availability (production) | Block or warn |

### Stage 4: In Progress

**What Happens:**
- Transaction is active
- Steps are tracked
- Inventory committed/reserved
- Documents can be added

**Status Updates:**
| Action | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| Step completion | Manual update |
| Partial receipt | Receiving action |
| Issues | Notes and flags |

### Stage 5: Completion

**What Happens:**
- Final receiving/confirmation
- Inventory fully updated
- Transaction becomes read-only
- Historical record created

**Completion Types:**
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Full** | All items received/completed |
| **Partial** | Some items, closed as complete |
| **Cancelled** | Order terminated |

## Step Management

### Updating Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Transaction">
    Open the transaction detail view
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to Steps Tab">
    Click on the Steps tab
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Current Step">
    Locate the next pending step
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark Complete">
    Click to complete the step:
    - Enter completion date/time
    - Add notes if needed
    - Attach documents if relevant
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Step is recorded, next step activates
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step Details

Each step can include:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Completion Date** | When step was completed |
| **Completed By** | User who updated |
| **Notes** | Additional information |
| **Documents** | Attached files |

### Skipping Steps

Some workflows allow skipping steps:

- Steps can be skipped if not applicable
- Provide reason when skipping
- Affects lead time calculations

<Warning>
  Skipping steps may impact reporting accuracy. Only skip when legitimately not applicable.
</Warning>

## Handling Issues

### Delays

When steps take longer than expected:

1. Add notes explaining delay
2. Update expected completion dates
3. Communicate with stakeholders
4. Consider impact on inventory

### Partial Fulfillment

When not all quantities are received:

| Option | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Wait** | More expected to arrive |
| **Backorder** | Order remainder separately |
| **Close Short** | Accept partial, close transaction |

### Cancellation

To cancel a transaction:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Impact">
    Understand what will be reversed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initiate Cancel">
    Click Cancel from transaction actions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide Reason">
    Document why cancellation is necessary
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm">
    System reverses inventory effects
  </Step>
</Steps>

**What Gets Reversed:**
- Committed inventory released
- Reserved components freed
- Incoming inventory removed

## Inventory Effects by Stage

### Purchase Orders

## Workflow Reporting

### Lead Time Analysis

Track actual vs. expected:
- Step durations
- Total order time
- Supplier performance
- Transit times

### Bottleneck Identification

Find where delays occur:
- Which steps take longest?
- Which suppliers are slow?
- Which warehouses are slow to receive?
