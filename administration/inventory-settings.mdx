## Fulfillment Mapping

### What is Fulfillment Mapping?

Defines which warehouses fulfill demand from which channels:

```
Channel → Warehouse(s)
```

### Why Fulfillment Mapping Matters

| Purpose | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Inventory Allocation** | Know where to stock |
| **Forecast Consumption** | Project inventory at right location |
| **Order Recommendations** | Replenish correct warehouse |

### Configuring Fulfillment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Inventory Settings">
    Navigate to inventory configuration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Fulfillment Mapping">
    Locate fulfillment configuration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Map Channels to Warehouses">
    For each channel, select fulfilling warehouse(s)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Priority">
    If multiple warehouses, set priority order
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Apply mapping
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Mapping

| Channel | Primary Warehouse | Secondary |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Shopify US | East Coast DC | West Coast DC |
| Amazon FBA | Amazon Fulfillment | - |
| Wholesale | Central Warehouse | - |
| Website CA | Canada DC | East Coast DC |

### Multi-Warehouse Fulfillment

When multiple warehouses can fulfill:

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Primary Only** | Always use primary |
| **Fallback** | Use secondary if primary out of stock |

## Inventory States

### Understanding Inventory States

Tether tracks inventory in multiple states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **On Hand** | Physically in warehouse |
| **Available** | On hand minus committed |
| **Committed** | Reserved for orders |
| **Incoming** | In transit to warehouse |
| **Sellable** | Available for new orders |

### State Calculations

```
Sellable = On Hand - Committed + Incoming
Available = On Hand - Committed
```

### Configuring State Display

Choose which states to display:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Navigate to inventory settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Display Options">
    Locate inventory state configuration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select States">
    Choose which states to show in dashboards
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Apply preferences
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Overstock Settings

### Configuring Overstock Alerts

Define when inventory is excessive:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|

| **Production** | For manufacturing orders |

### Configuring Defaults

## Inventory Health Rules

### Health Status Configuration

Define thresholds for health status:

| Status | Default Rule |
|--------|--------------|
| **Out of Stock** | Sellable = 0 |
| **Low Inventory** | Below safety stock |
| **Healthy** | Between safety and overstock |
| **Overstock** | Above overstock threshold |

### Customizing Health Rules

Adjust thresholds based on your business:

| Parameter | Adjustment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Critical Days** | When to show urgent |
| **Low Days** | When to show warning |
| **Overstock Days** | When excess starts |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Conservative">
    Begin with higher safety stocks:
    - Learn demand patterns
    - Reduce gradually
    - Better to have excess initially
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Segment by Product">
    Different settings for different products:
    - High-value: higher safety stock
    - Fast-moving: more buffer
    - Slow-moving: lower buffer
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Regularly">
    Update settings as business changes:
    - Seasonal adjustments
    - After supply chain changes
    - When adding new products
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Decisions">
    Keep records of configuration choices:
    - Why settings were chosen
    - Who approved
    - When to review
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Incorrect Inventory Projections

**Possible causes:**
- Wrong fulfillment mapping
