# Forecast Dashboard

The Demand Forecast Dashboard is where you view, analyze, and adjust demand predictions for your products. Accurate forecasts are essential for inventory planning and supply chain efficiency.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Navigate to **Demand Forecast** in the sidebar.

<Note>
  Both Admin and Sales Rep users can access the forecast dashboard. Editing capabilities may vary by role.
</Note>

## Dashboard Layout

The forecast dashboard consists of:

1. **Filter Panel** (left) - Narrow down the data
2. **Toolbar** (top) - Actions, grouping, and view options

## Understanding the Data Table

The data table shows forecasts in a grid format:

### Rows

Each row represents a unique combination of:
- SKU
- Channel
- Other grouping dimensions

### Columns

Columns represent time periods:
- Days (for short-term view)
- Weeks (for medium-term)
- Months (for longer horizons)

### Cell Values

Each cell shows the forecasted quantity for that SKU/channel/period combination.

| Cell State | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| **Number** | Forecasted units |
| **-** | No forecast (zero or null) |
| **Highlighted** | Recently edited |
| **Grayed** | Historical (past period) |

## Time Period Selection

| **Next 30 Days** | Coming month |
