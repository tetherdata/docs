# Promotions

Promotions are marketing events that affect demand. Tether allows you to define promotions so their impact on forecasts can be properly accounted for.

<Note>
  Managing promotions requires Admin access.
</Note>

## Why Track Promotions?

Promotions cause demand spikes that disrupt normal patterns:

| Without Promotion Tracking | With Promotion Tracking |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Forecast assumes normal demand | Forecast adjusts for promotion |
| May stockout during event | Adequate inventory planned |
| May overstock after event | Smooth transition back to normal |
| Hard to measure promo impact | Clear lift measurement |

### How Tether Uses Promotions

1. **Identifies Promotion Period** - Start and end dates
2. **Applies Lift** - Increases forecast by specified percentage
3. **Limits to Scope** - Only affects specified SKUs/channels
4. **Maintains History** - Past promotions inform similar future events

### Lift Calculation

**Example:**
- Base forecast: 100 units/day
- Promotion lift: 40%
- Promoted forecast: 140 units/day

### Pre and Post Effects

Consider effects outside the promotion window:

| Period | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Pre-promotion** | Customers may wait to buy |
| **During promotion** | Lift occurs |
| **Post-promotion** | Demand may dip below normal |

<Tip>
  For major promotions, extend the date range or manually adjust the surrounding periods.
