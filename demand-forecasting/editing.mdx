# Editing Forecasts

While Tether generates forecasts automatically, you often need to make adjustments based on business knowledge, planned promotions, or other factors. This guide covers all the ways to edit forecast values.

<Note>
  Editing capabilities depend on your role. Admins have full access; Sales Reps may have limited editing rights.
</Note>

## Why Edit Forecasts?

Common reasons to adjust forecasts:

| Reason | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Planned Promotions** | Marketing campaign will drive extra demand |
| **Product Launches** | New product with no history |
| **Seasonal Events** | Holiday peak not captured in model |
| **Market Changes** | Competitor exit, trend shift |
| **Known Issues** | Supply constraints, discontinuation |

## Inline Cell Editing

The quickest way to make changes is directly in the forecast table.

Documenting why you made changes helps with analysis and audit.

3. Enter a brief explanation:
   - "Holiday promotion expected"
   - "New marketing campaign"
   - "Product phase-out"

For important changes, the Save Reason Modal provides more structure:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Category** | Type of change (promotion, seasonal, market, etc.) |
| **Description** | Detailed explanation |

### Why Reasons Matter

3. Group totals update automatically

### Editing Group Totals

Some views allow editing at the group level:

1. Edit the group total
2. System distributes change to detail rows
3. Distribution method depends on configuration

<Warning>
  Editing group totals may distribute changes in ways you don't expect. Review detail rows after group-level edits.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always Add Reasons">
    Document every significant change. Future you (and your team) will thank you.
