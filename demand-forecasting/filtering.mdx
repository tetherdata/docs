# Filtering & Grouping

With potentially thousands of SKU/channel combinations, effective filtering and grouping is essential for working with forecast data efficiently.

## Filter Panel

The filter panel appears on the left side of the forecast dashboard.

### Available Filters

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Search** | Text search across SKU names and codes |
| **Channel** | Filter by sales channel |
| **Channel Hierarchy** | Filter by channel groupings |
| **Collection** | Filter by product collection |
| **Product Hierarchy** | Filter by product categories |
| **SKU** | Select specific SKUs |
| **Dimensions** | Filter by product attributes |

## Filtering by Channel

Focus on specific sales channels:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Expand Channel Filter">
    Click on the **Channel** section in the filter panel
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Channels">
    Check the channels you want to view:
    - Shopify US
    - Amazon
    - Wholesale
    - etc.
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Results">
    Table shows only forecasts for selected channels
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Channel Hierarchy

If you have channel groupings configured:

```
All Channels
├── Direct to Consumer
│   ├── Shopify US
│   └── Shopify CA
├── Marketplaces
│   ├── Amazon US
│   └── Amazon UK
└── Wholesale
    └── B2B Portal
```

Filter at any level to see all channels below that point.

## Filtering by Product

### Collection Filter

Filter by product collections:

1. Expand the **Collection** filter
2. Select collections to include
3. See only SKUs from those collections

### Product Hierarchy Filter

Filter using your product categorization:

1. Expand **Product Hierarchy**
2. Select values at any level
3. All products in that category are shown

### Specific SKU Selection

To view only certain SKUs:

1. Use the **SKU** filter
2. Search or browse for specific SKUs
3. Check the SKUs you want
4. Only selected SKUs appear

## Combining Filters

Filters work together using AND logic:

**Example:**
- Channel = "Shopify US" AND
- Collection = "T-Shirts" AND
- Product Hierarchy > Category = "Apparel"

Shows: T-Shirts in Apparel category sold on Shopify US

<Info>
  All filters must match for a row to appear. If results are empty, try removing some filters.
</Info>

## Grouping Options

Grouping organizes how data is displayed in the table.

### Standard Groupings

| Option | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **No Grouping** | Flat list of all SKU/channel combinations |
| **By Channel** | Groups rows by channel first |
| **By Collection** | Groups rows by collection first |

## Troubleshooting

### No Results After Filtering

**Causes:**
- Filters are too restrictive
- Data doesn't exist for the combination
- Date range has no forecasts

**Solutions:**
1. Remove some filters
2. Verify data exists for selected channels/SKUs
3. Expand the date range

### Slow Performance

**Causes:**
- Too much data displayed
- Complex grouping with large dataset

**Solutions:**
1. Add filters to reduce data volume
2. Use higher aggregation (monthly vs. daily)
3. Collapse groups when not needed
