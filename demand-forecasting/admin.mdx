# Forecast Administration

The Forecast Admin section provides tools for configuring how forecasts are generated, managing bulk data, and controlling forecast versions. These settings significantly impact forecast quality.

<Note>
  Forecast Administration is restricted to Admin users.
</Note>

## Accessing Forecast Admin

Navigate to **Demand Forecast** → **Admin** (or through the settings menu).

## Admin Tabs

The Forecast Admin page has multiple tabs:

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Settings** | Model selection and configuration |
| **Upload** | Bulk forecast data imports |
| **Versioning** | Manage forecast versions |

## Model Selection

A **model** is a method for generating a possible forecast. Each model uses an **algorithm** that defines how forecast values are calculated. Your organization can define multiple models with different algorithms and compare their outputs before selecting one as active.

<Tip>
  For a deep dive into how each algorithm works, including mathematical formulas and parameter details, see the [Forecast Algorithms](/demand-forecasting/algorithms) page.
</Tip>

### Available algorithms

Tether provides 11 forecast algorithms you can assign to models:

| Algorithm | Description | Best for | Supports auto-tune |
|-----------|-------------|----------|:------------------:|
| **90-Day Rolling Average** | Simple arithmetic mean of the last 90 days of sales | Stable, predictable demand | No |
| **120-Day Rolling Average (Recursive)** | Sliding window average that incorporates prior forecast values as it projects forward | Volatile products, strategic planning | No |
| **Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)** | Applies exponential decay weighting to emphasize recent sales | Trending products, fashion items | Yes |
| **Linear Trend** | Least-squares linear regression projected forward | Products with consistent growth or decline | No |
| **Simplified Seasonal** | Weighted combination of weekly (80%) and monthly (20%) seasonal patterns | Seasonal and holiday-driven products | Yes |
| **Simple Seasonal with Trend Adjustment** | Seasonal patterns blended with a year-over-year growth factor | Seasonal products with growth trends | Yes |
| **Seasonal Year-over-Year Growth** | Seasonal baseline multiplied by observed year-over-year growth rate | Seasonal products with strong annual growth | Yes |
| **Rolling Momentum** | Detects acceleration or deceleration by comparing short-term vs long-term moving averages | Viral, accelerating, or declining products | Yes |
| **Holt-Winters (Triple Exponential Smoothing)** | Captures level, trend, and seasonality with separate smoothing factors | Complex seasonal patterns with trends | Yes |
| **SARIMA** | Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average for complex time series | Complex time series with seasonal and trend components | Yes |
| **Static Baseline** | Directly uses uploaded baseline forecast values with no algorithmic processing | External forecasts, manual imports, hybrid workflows | No |

### Creating a model

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Models tab">
    Navigate to **Demand Forecast** → **Admin** and open the **Models** tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Create Model">
    Click **Create Model** to open the model creation dialog.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the model">
    Provide a name and description, then select an algorithm from the list above.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save**. The system calculates the model's output for all SKU-channel combinations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Selecting the active model

Only one model can be active at a time. The active model drives the official sales forecast used by downstream processes (consumption forecast, inventory forecast, and reorder calculations).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Compare model outputs">
    Use the [Forecast Comparison](/demand-forecasting/comparison) view or click a row in the forecast table to open the model selection dialog and see outputs from all models side by side.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a model">
    Choose the model you want to activate and confirm your selection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Forecast regenerates">
    The system regenerates the official sales forecast using the selected model's algorithm.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Changing the active model triggers an immediate forecast regeneration for all SKU-channel combinations.
</Note>

### Parameter optimization (auto-tune)

Seven of the 11 algorithms support **automatic parameter optimization**. When enabled, the system finds the best parameter values by minimizing forecast error on historical data.

**Optimization methods:**
- **Nelder-Mead Simplex** — used for algorithms with continuous parameters (e.g., smoothing factors, weights). Iteratively adjusts parameters to minimize error.
- **Grid Search** — used for SARIMA, which has discrete integer parameters (AR/MA orders). Tests all combinations within specified ranges.

**Error metrics available for optimization:**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **MSE** (Mean Squared Error) | Penalizes large errors heavily (default) |
| **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error) | More robust to outliers |
| **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) | Scale-independent comparison across SKUs |

**Per-SKU/channel optimization:** Optimized parameters are stored per SKU-channel combination, so each product-channel pair can have its own tuned settings within a model.

### Key algorithm parameters

Each algorithm has configurable parameters. Here are the most commonly tuned ones:

**Rolling Average:**
- `window_days` — number of days to average (default: 90 or 120)

**EWMA:**
- `window_days` — window size in days (default: 60)
- `weight_factor` — exponential decay factor, 0.1–0.99 (default: 0.8). Lower values emphasize recent data more heavily.

**Holt-Winters:**
- `alpha` — level smoothing, 0.0–1.0 (default: 0.2)
- `beta` — trend smoothing, 0.0–1.0 (default: 0.1)
- `gamma` — seasonal smoothing, 0.0–1.0 (default: 0.1)
- `phi` — trend damping, 0.8–1.0 (default: 0.95). Values below 1.0 prevent unrealistic long-term trend extrapolation.

**SARIMA:**
- `ar_order`, `diff_order`, `ma_order` — non-seasonal ARIMA orders
- `seasonal_ar_order`, `seasonal_diff_order` — seasonal orders
- `seasonal_period` — season length in days (default: 365)

**Rolling Momentum:**
- `short_window_days` — recent performance window (default: 30)
- `long_window_days` — baseline comparison window (default: 90)
- `sensitivity` — momentum reaction strength, 0.0–1.0 (default: 0.5)

## Versioning

### What is Forecast Versioning?

Versioning maintains historical snapshots of forecasts:

| Version Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Current** | Active forecast being used |
| **Historical** | Past versions for comparison |
| **Draft** | Work-in-progress (not active) |

### Versioning Tab

The Versioning tab shows:

- List of forecast versions
- Version dates and descriptions
- Actions (view, restore, compare)

### Creating a Version

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Versioning Tab">
    Open the Versioning tab
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Create Version">
    Start a new version snapshot
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Details">
    - Name: "Q1 2024 Plan"
    - Description: Reason for version
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Version is created and stored
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Comparing Versions

Compare forecast versions:

1. Select two versions
2. Click **Compare**
3. View differences by SKU/channel/period

### Restoring a Version

To revert to a previous version:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Version">
    Click on the version to restore
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Restore">
    Choose **Restore** action
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm">
    Review what will change and confirm
  </Step>

  <Step title="Version Active">
    Selected version becomes current
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Restoring a version replaces the current forecast. Consider creating a version of the current state first.
</Warning>

## Forecast Regeneration

### When forecasts regenerate

The system recalculates model outputs automatically when:

- **A model definition is modified** — the system immediately recalculates that model's outputs for all SKU-channel combinations. If the modified model is the currently selected model, the official forecast is also regenerated.
- **The active model is changed** — selecting a different model triggers a full forecast regeneration using the new model's algorithm.
- **Historical data is updated** — events like data syncs or manual sales history uploads trigger a recalculation of all active model outputs.
- **A daily update occurs** — scheduled regeneration recalculates forecasts with the latest available data.

### Manual regeneration

To manually trigger a forecast update:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Forecast Admin">
    Navigate to **Demand Forecast** → **Admin**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Regenerate">
    Click the **Regenerate Forecasts** button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm to start the regeneration process. The system recalculates model outputs for all SKU-channel combinations using the currently selected model's algorithm.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Regeneration recalculates algorithmic model outputs. User edits made through the [Consensus Model editing workflow](/demand-forecasting/editing) are preserved — they are not overwritten by regeneration.
</Info>

## Data Quality

### Data requirements by algorithm

Different algorithms have different minimum data requirements:

| Algorithm | Minimum history |
|-----------|----------------|
| Rolling Average, EWMA, Linear Trend, Rolling Momentum | 30–120 days (depending on window size) |
| Simplified Seasonal, Seasonal YoY Growth, Holt-Winters, SARIMA | 365+ days (at least 1 full seasonal cycle) |
| Static Baseline | No historical data needed (uses uploaded values) |

<Warning>
  Seasonal algorithms (Simplified Seasonal, Holt-Winters, SARIMA, Seasonal YoY Growth) automatically fall back to a 90-day rolling average if fewer than 365 days of history are available.
</Warning>

### Data quality indicators

Watch for warnings about:

- SKUs with insufficient sales history for the selected algorithm
- Channels with sparse or missing data
- Products with high variability that may need a different algorithm
- Recent data gaps that could skew forecasts

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Model selection">
    - Start with simpler algorithms (e.g., 90-Day Rolling Average) and compare against more complex ones (e.g., Holt-Winters, SARIMA).
    - Use the [Forecast Comparison](/demand-forecasting/comparison) view to evaluate accuracy before switching.
    - Consider using different models for different product segments — stable products may perform best with Rolling Average, while seasonal products benefit from Simplified Seasonal or Holt-Winters.
    - Enable parameter optimization (auto-tune) for algorithms that support it to find the best settings per SKU-channel combination.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular updates">
    Keep forecasts current:
    - Ensure regular regeneration so forecasts incorporate the latest sales data.
    - Monitor data freshness — stale sales history leads to outdated forecasts.
    - Periodically review model accuracy and consider switching algorithms if performance degrades.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Version discipline">
    Use versioning effectively:
    - Create a version snapshot before switching the active model.
    - Name versions descriptively (e.g., "Before SARIMA switch Q1 2026").
    - Compare versions during planning cycles to track forecast evolution.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Upload carefully">
    Handle bulk uploads with care:
    - Validate data before upload — ensure SKU codes and channel names match existing records.
    - Always preview changes before confirming.
    - Create a version snapshot of the current forecast state before uploading.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Forecasts not updating

**Possible causes:**
- No regeneration has been triggered (manual or automatic).
- The modified model is not the currently selected model — only the selected model drives the official forecast.
- Data sync has not completed, so the latest sales history is not yet available.

**Solutions:**
1. Trigger a manual regeneration from the Admin page.
2. Verify which model is currently selected and confirm it's the one you expect.
3. Check that data integrations have synced successfully.

### Upload errors

**Common issues:**
- Wrong template type (date template vs. period template).
- SKU codes or channel names that don't match existing records.
- Invalid date format (use `MM/DD/YYYY` or `YYYY-MM-DD`).
- Mixing date and period columns in the same file.

**Solutions:**
1. Download the correct template for your organization's period configuration.
2. Verify all SKU codes and channel names exist in the system before uploading.
3. Check for non-numeric or negative quantity values.
4. Ensure no special characters or encoding issues in the CSV file.
