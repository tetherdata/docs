## Integration with Forecasts

Sales history feeds into forecasting:

### How Forecasts Use History

1. **Baseline** - Historical patterns establish baseline
2. **Trends** - Growth/decline rates inform projections
3. **Seasonality** - Past seasonal patterns project forward
4. **Model Training** - Algorithms learn from history

### Data Quality Impact

Better history data = better forecasts:

- Complete data improves accuracy
- Consistent tracking helps patterns
- Flagged anomalies prevent distortion
