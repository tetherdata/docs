# Navigation & Interface Overview

Tether's interface is designed for efficiency, with intuitive navigation and powerful data management capabilities. This guide helps you understand the layout and key interface patterns.

## Main Layout

The Tether interface consists of these primary areas:

- **Top Navigation Bar** - Logo, search, and user menu
- **Sidebar Navigation** - Main feature navigation (collapsible)
- **Main Content Area** - Where you'll do most of your work

## Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar is your primary navigation tool. It can be expanded or collapsed to maximize screen space.

### Admin Navigation

Admin users see the full navigation menu:

| Section | Sub-items |
|---------|-----------|
| **SKUs** | Dimensions, Collections, Product Hierarchy, SKUs |
| **Inventory** | Report, Warehouses, Suppliers |
| **Demand Forecast** | Dashboard, Comparison, Admin, Sales History, Promotions, Edit Log |
| **Integrations** | Data Ingestion |
| **Channels** | Channel List, Hierarchy |
| **Transactions** | *(direct link)* |

<Info>
  **Settings** is accessed from the user menu (profile avatar) in the top-right corner, not from the sidebar. Only Admins can see the Settings option.
</Info>

### Sales Rep Navigation

Sales Rep users see a simplified menu:

| Section | Sub-items |
|---------|-----------|
| **SKUs** | Collections, SKUs |
| **Demand Forecast** | Dashboard, Comparison, Sales History, Edit Log |
| **Channels** | Channel List |

### Collapsing the Sidebar

Click the collapse button at the bottom of the sidebar to minimize it. This gives you more screen space for data-heavy views like the SKU dashboard or forecast tables.

## Top Navigation Bar

The top bar provides:

- **Logo/Home**: Click to return to the main dashboard
- **Search**: Quick access to the command palette (also `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`)
- **User Menu**: Access settings (Admin only), view your role, and log out

## Page Layouts

### Tab-Based Pages

Many pages use tabs to organize related content. For example, the Inventory page has:

- **Overview** - Alerts and health status
- **Supply Plan** - Scheduled orders
- **Forecast** - Inventory projections
- **Flow** - Visual replenishment diagram

<Tip>
  Tab selection is preserved in the URL, so you can bookmark or share links to specific tabs.
</Tip>

### Detail Pages

When you click into a specific item (SKU, warehouse, transaction, etc.), you'll see a detail page with:

- **Header**: Name, status, and quick actions
- **Tabs**: Different aspects of the item
- **Content Area**: Forms, tables, or visualizations

## Data Tables

Tether uses powerful data tables throughout the application. Here's how to use them effectively:

### Column Features

| Feature | How to Use |
|---------|------------|
| **Sort** | Click column header to sort ascending/descending |
| **Resize** | Drag column borders to adjust width |
| **Reorder** | Drag column headers to rearrange |
| **Pin** | Right-click header to pin columns left or right |
| **Hide** | Use column visibility controls to show/hide columns |

### Inline Editing

Many tables support inline editing:

1. Click on an editable cell (indicated by subtle highlighting on hover)
2. Make your changes
3. Press `Enter` to save or `Escape` to cancel
4. Changes are saved automatically

<Warning>
  Some fields may require specific formats (dates, numbers, etc.). Invalid entries will show an error.
</Warning>

### Filtering

Tables typically include a filter panel on the left side:

- **Text Search**: Type to search across visible columns
- **Multi-Select Filters**: Check/uncheck values to filter
- **Tri-State Selection**: Some filters support Include/Exclude/Indifferent states
- **Date Ranges**: Select start and end dates for time-based filtering

### Row Selection

- **Single Select**: Click a row to select it
- **Multi-Select**: Hold `Cmd` (Mac) or `Ctrl` (Windows) and click multiple rows
- **Range Select**: Click first row, hold `Shift`, click last row

## Modal Dialogs

Modals appear for:

- Creating new items
- Editing details
- Confirming actions
- Viewing additional information

### Modal Controls

- **Close**: Click the X button or press `Escape`
- **Save**: Click the primary action button (usually blue)
- **Cancel**: Click Cancel or close the modal

<Info>
  Some modals have multiple steps. Look for "Next" and "Back" buttons to navigate.

## Filters & Saved Views

### Using Filters

1. Open the filter panel (usually on the left side of data tables)
2. Expand filter sections by clicking the headers
3. Select values to include or exclude
4. Results update automatically

### Tri-State Filtering

Some filters support three states:

| State | Icon | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Include** | ✓ | Show only items matching this value |
| **Exclude** | ✗ | Hide items matching this value |
| **Indifferent** | - | Don't filter by this value |

### Saving Views

If you frequently use the same filter combination:

1. Set up your desired filters
2. Click **Save View**
3. Enter a name for the view
4. Access saved views from the dropdown

## Command Palette

The command palette provides quick access to navigation and search:
