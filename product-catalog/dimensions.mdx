# Dimensions

Dimensions define the variable attributes of your products. They're the backbone of variant management, enabling you to create and organize products with different sizes, colors, materials, and more.

## What Are Dimensions?

A dimension is a product attribute that varies across SKUs within a collection. Common examples:

| Dimension | Purpose | Example Values |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Size** | Physical size | XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL |
| **Color** | Visual appearance | Red, Blue, Black, White |
| **Material** | Composition | Cotton, Polyester, Leather |
| **Length** | Measurement variant | Short, Regular, Long |
| **Width** | Fit type | Narrow, Standard, Wide |
| **Flavor** | Product variety | Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry |
| **Scent** | Fragrance type | Lavender, Citrus, Unscented |

## Dimensions vs. Other Attributes

Understanding when to use dimensions:

| Use Dimensions When | Use Other Fields When |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Attribute varies within a product line | Attribute is unique to each SKU |
| You need to filter by this attribute | It's just informational |
| Products share the attribute values | Values are product-specific |
| You want to generate SKU variants | You're describing a single product |

**Example:**
- "Size" should be a dimension (T-Shirts come in S, M, L)
- "Weight" might be a SKU field (each product has one specific weight)

## The Dimensions Dashboard

Access the dimensions dashboard from **SKUs** → **Dimensions** in the main navigation.

### Dashboard Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dimension Hierarchy** | Shows the current ordering of dimensions with drag-and-drop reordering |
| **Dimension List** | All dimensions with their ranges, values, and position |
| **Search** | Find dimensions by name or description |
| **New Dimension** | Create new dimensions |

### Current Dimension Hierarchy

The dashboard prominently displays the **Current Dimension Hierarchy** card, which shows the order dimensions are applied throughout the application. This ordering affects SKU code generation and how variants are organized.

- Click **Reorder** to enter drag mode
- Drag dimensions using the grip handle to rearrange
- Click **Save Order** to persist changes, or **Cancel** to discard

<Info>
  The Reorder button is only available when you have at least 2 dimensions.
</Info>

## Creating Dimensions

### From the Dimensions Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Dimensions">
    Go to **SKUs** → **Dimensions** in the navigation menu
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click New Dimension">
    Click the **New Dimension** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Basic Information">
    - **Dimension Name** (required): Display name (e.g., "Size", "Color", "Material")
    - **Description** (optional): Explain the dimension's purpose
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Values">
    Add values with both a name and a SKU code:
    - **Value Name**: Human-readable label (e.g., "Small")
    - **SKU Code**: Short identifier used in SKU generation (e.g., "SM")
    - Press **Enter** or click **+** to add each value
    - At least one value is required
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Dimension">
    Click **Create Dimension** to save. A default "Standard" range is automatically created containing your values.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Dimensions are organization-wide, not collection-specific. Once created, dimensions can be assigned to any collection from the collection's **Dimensions** tab.
</Info>

### From a Collection

You can also assign existing dimensions to a collection:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Collection">
    Navigate to the collection's detail page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to Dimensions Tab">
    Select the **Dimensions** tab
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Dimensions">
    Use the dimension manager to assign existing dimensions to the collection
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Dimension Detail Page

Click on any dimension in the list to open its detail page. The detail page shows:

- **Dimension Details**: Name, description, default range, and total range count
- **Dimension Ranges**: Cards for each range showing its values

You can edit the dimension's name and description by clicking the **Edit** button in the Dimension Details card.

## Ranges and Values

Dimensions use a **range-based** structure. Each dimension has one or more ranges, and each range contains a set of values. This allows the same dimension to have different value sets for different contexts.

**Example:** A "Size" dimension might have:
- **US Sizes** range: XS, S, M, L, XL
- **EU Sizes** range: 34, 36, 38, 40, 42

When you create a dimension, a default "Standard" range is automatically created with your initial values.

### Adding a Range

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Dimension">
    Click on a dimension to open its detail page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Add Range">
    Click the **Add Range** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Range Details">
    - **Range Name** (required): e.g., "EU Sizes"
    - **Description** (optional): Explain the range's purpose
    - Add values with names and SKU codes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Add Range** to save
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Editing Values in a Range

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Dimension">
    Click on a dimension to open its detail page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Edit Values">
    On the range card, click **Edit Values**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Changes">
    In the modal:
    - Click **Add Value** to add new values (name + SKU code required)
    - Click the edit icon to modify existing values
    - Click the delete icon to remove values
    - New and modified items show status badges
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save Changes** — all changes are batched and saved together
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Changing a value's name doesn't change existing SKUs that use it. The relationship is by ID, not name.
</Info>

### Validation Rules

- Value name and SKU code are both required
- SKU codes must be unique within a range
- SKU codes can be up to 20 characters
- SKU codes can contain letters, numbers, and: `- . / _ % # ( ) : + = @`
- Duplicate value names within a range are not allowed

## Dimension Hierarchy

The dimension hierarchy determines the order in which dimensions appear throughout the application, including how product variants are organized and SKU codes are generated.

### Viewing the Hierarchy

The **Current Dimension Hierarchy** section on the dimension dashboard shows all active dimensions in their current order. Each dimension displays its position number and name.

<Info>
  The dimension hierarchy determines the order used throughout the application for organizing product variants and generating SKU codes.
</Info>

### Reordering the Hierarchy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Reorder">
    Click the **Reorder** button in the hierarchy section header (requires at least 2 dimensions)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Drag and Drop">
    Drag dimensions to rearrange them into the desired order. A drag handle appears next to each dimension.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save or Cancel">
    Click **Save Order** to apply the new hierarchy, or **Cancel** to discard changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Reordering the hierarchy will affect future SKU generation. Existing SKU codes are not changed.
</Warning>

## Value SKU Codes

Each dimension value has a **SKU code** — a short identifier used in SKU code generation. SKU codes are set when you create or edit values.

### SKU Code Rules

- Maximum 20 characters
- Allowed characters: letters, numbers, and `- . / _ % # ( ) : + = @`
- Must be unique within a range
- Automatically converted to uppercase

### Best Practices

| Guideline | Good | Bad |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Keep short | "M", "BLU" | "MEDIUM", "BLUECOLOR" |
| Be consistent | All 2-3 chars | Mix of lengths |
| Avoid ambiguity | "NVY" for Navy | "N" (too vague) |
| Use uppercase | "XL" | "xl" |

### Examples

| Dimension | Value | SKU Code |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Size | Extra Small | XS |
| Size | Small | S |
| Size | Medium | M |
| Color | Navy Blue | NVY |
| Color | Forest Green | FGR |
| Material | 100% Cotton | COT |

## Dimensions and SKU Generation

Dimensions power the SKU Generator, which creates variant combinations automatically.

### How It Works

1. Define dimensions with values and SKU codes
2. Open the SKU Generator from a collection
3. Select which dimension values to include
4. The generator creates all combinations

**Example:**
- Size: S, M, L (3 values)
- Color: Red, Blue (2 values)
- Result: 6 SKUs (3 × 2)

The dimension hierarchy order determines how SKU codes are assembled. For example, if Size is first and Color is second, the generated code might be `TSH-M-BLU` (collection code + size code + color code).

## Dimension Filtering

Dimensions appear as filters on the SKU dashboard. Each active dimension with values becomes a filter group in the filter panel.

### Tri-State Filtering

Dimension filters support three states:

| State | Visual | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Indifferent** | Empty checkbox | Don't filter by this value (default) |
| **Include** | Green checkmark | Show only SKUs with this value |
| **Exclude** | Red X | Hide SKUs with this value |

Click a value once to include it, click again to exclude it, and click a third time to return to indifferent.

## Troubleshooting

### Dimension Not Appearing in Filters

**Cause:** No SKUs have values for this dimension

**Solution:**
1. Assign dimension values to SKUs
2. Or use the SKU Generator to create variants with dimension values

### Duplicate SKU Codes

**Cause:** Same SKU code used within a range

**Solution:**
- SKU codes only need to be unique within a single range
- Different ranges can have overlapping SKU codes
- If this causes confusion, use more descriptive codes

### Cannot Reorder Hierarchy

**Cause:** Only one dimension exists

**Solution:**
- The **Reorder** button requires at least two dimensions
- Create additional dimensions before reordering
