# Collections Overview

Collections are the primary way to organize and group related SKUs in Tether. They provide shared configurations, dimensions, and settings that apply to all SKUs within the collection.

## What is a Collection?

A collection is a logical grouping of related products. Think of it as a product line or category that shares common characteristics.

**Examples:**
- "T-Shirts" - all t-shirt variants
- "Electronics" - electronic products
- "Summer 2024" - seasonal product line
- "Accessories" - bags, hats, belts

## Why Use Collections?

Collections provide several benefits:

    Define Size, Color, and other attributes once, use across all SKUs in the collection
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bulk Operations" icon="layer-group">
    Apply settings, pricing, or updates to all SKUs in a collection at once
  </Card>
  <Card title="SKU Generation" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Automatically create SKU variants from dimension combinations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Organization" icon="folder-tree">
    Keep your catalog organized and easy to navigate
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The Collections Dashboard

Navigate to **SKUs** → **Collections** tab to access the collections dashboard.

### Dashboard Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Collection List** | All collections with key information |
| **Search** | Find collections by name |
| **Status Filter** | Show Active, Archived, or All |
| **Create Button** | Add new collections |

### Collection Information

Each collection shows:

- **Name** - Collection display name
- **Description** - Optional details
- **SKU Count** - Number of SKUs in the collection
- **Status** - Draft or Active (lifecycle status)
- **Archived** - Whether the collection is archived
- **Created Date** - When the collection was created

<Note>
  Collections have two separate status indicators: **Status** (Draft/Active) indicates if the collection is still being configured or ready for use, while **Archived** indicates if the collection has been soft-deleted from active views.
</Note>

## Collection vs. Product Hierarchy

Collections and product hierarchies serve different purposes:

| Feature | Collection | Product Hierarchy |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Purpose** | Group SKUs with shared attributes | Categorize for reporting |
| **Dimensions** | Yes, defines available attributes | No |
| **SKU Generation** | Yes | No |
| **Nesting** | Flat (one level) | Multi-level (up to 5) |
| **SKU Membership** | Each SKU in one collection | Can be in multiple hierarchy levels |

<Info>
  Use collections for products that share dimensions. Use product hierarchy for reporting and categorization that spans collections.
</Info>

## Collection Structure

A collection detail page contains the following tabs:

### Overview Tab
Basic collection information including name, description, and hierarchy field values (up to 5 levels).

### Dimensions Tab
Define product attributes like Size, Color, Material. Each dimension has values that SKUs can use.

### SKUs Tab
All SKUs belonging to this collection. Add, remove, or generate SKUs here.

### Hierarchy Tab
Configure how this collection fits into your product hierarchy for reporting.

### Inventory Tab
Aggregate view of inventory for all SKUs in the collection.

### Suppliers Tab
Suppliers who provide products in this collection.

### Pricing Tab
Collection-level pricing configuration and pricing matrix.

### BOM Tab
Bill of materials for products that share components.

### Settings Tab
Collection metadata and configuration options.

## Creating Collections

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Collections">
    Go to **SKUs** → **Collections** tab
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Create Collection">
    Click the **Create Collection** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Details">
    - **Name**: Descriptive name for the collection
    - **Description**: Optional details
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to create the collection
  </Step>
</Steps>

After creating, you'll want to:
1. Set up dimensions (if products have variants)
2. Add or generate SKUs
3. Configure suppliers and pricing

## Collection Status

Collections can be Active or Archived:

| Status | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Active** | Visible in default views, SKUs can be added |
| **Archived** | Hidden from default views, no new SKUs |

<Note>
  Archiving a collection doesn't affect its SKUs. They remain in the system but the collection is hidden from navigation.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Group by Shared Attributes">
    Put products together when they share the same dimensions. All t-shirts might share Size and Color, so they belong in one collection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep Collections Focused">
    Don't make collections too broad. "All Products" isn't useful. "Summer T-Shirts" is more manageable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plan Dimensions First">
    Before creating SKUs, define your dimensions. It's harder to add dimensions after SKUs exist.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Name collections clearly. Future team members should understand what's in a collection from its name.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Workflows

### Launching a New Product Line

1. Create a new collection
2. Define dimensions (Size, Color, etc.)
3. Use SKU Generator to create all variants
4. Configure suppliers and pricing
5. Enable on channels

### Managing Seasonal Products

1. Create seasonal collections ("Spring 2024")
2. Add new products to the seasonal collection
3. At end of season, archive the collection
4. Historical data is preserved

### Reorganizing Products

1. Create new collections with better structure
2. Move SKUs to appropriate collections
3. Archive old collections
4. Update any integrations referencing old collections
