# Product Hierarchy

Product hierarchy provides a field-based categorization system for organizing your products for reporting, filtering, and analysis. Unlike dimensions (which vary within a product), hierarchy defines how products are categorized.

## What is Product Hierarchy?

Product hierarchy uses up to 5 independent classification fields to categorize your products. Each field can be activated with a custom label and populated with values. Common uses include:

- **Reporting** — Aggregate data at different categorization levels
- **Filtering** — Find products by category on the SKU dashboard
- **Organization** — Logical grouping of products
- **Analysis** — Compare performance across categories

### Example Fields

| Field | Custom Label | Example Values |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Field 1 | Category | Apparel, Accessories, Footwear |
| Field 2 | Sub-Category | Tops, Bottoms, Outerwear |
| Field 3 | Product Line | T-Shirts, Dress Shirts, Polos |
| Field 4 | Brand | Premium, Standard, Basics |
| Field 5 | Season | Spring 2026, Summer 2026 |

## Hierarchy vs. Collections vs. Dimensions

Understanding when to use each:

| Feature | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Hierarchy** | Categorization for reporting | Category, Sub-Category |
| **Collections** | Group products with shared dimensions | "T-Shirts" collection |
| **Dimensions** | Product variants | Size, Color |

<Info>
  Hierarchy fields are independent of each other. Each field has its own set of values, and a product can be assigned a value for any combination of active fields.
</Info>

## The Hierarchy Dashboard

Navigate to **SKUs** → **Product Hierarchy** to access the hierarchy dashboard.

### Dashboard Overview

The dashboard displays:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Active Fields** | Count of currently activated fields out of 5 total |
| **Total Values** | Combined count of values across all active fields |
| **Hierarchy Fields Table** | All 5 fields with their status, label, values, and actions |

### Field Table Columns

Each row in the hierarchy fields table shows:

- **Field #** — Field number (1–5)
- **Status** — Active or Inactive badge
- **Custom Label** — The label you've assigned (e.g., "Category")
- **Values** — All values for the field shown as badges, with a **+** button to add more
- **Actions** — Dropdown menu with field management options

## Configuring Hierarchy Fields

Tether supports up to 5 hierarchy fields. Each field starts as inactive and must be activated with a custom label before you can add values.

### Activating a Field

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Actions Menu">
    Click the **⋯** menu on an inactive field row
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Activate Field">
    Select **Activate Field** from the dropdown
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter a Custom Label">
    Provide a label for the field (e.g., "Category", "Sub-Category", "Brand"). Example placeholders shown: Category, Sub-Category, Brand.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Activate">
    Click **Activate Field** to save
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Editing a Field Label

For active fields, click **⋯** → **Edit Label** to change the custom label.

### Deactivating a Field

Click **⋯** → **Deactivate** on an active field to deactivate it. Deactivated fields retain their configuration but are no longer shown in filters or assignment options.

### Managing Field Values

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Value Management">
    Click **⋯** → **Manage Values** on an active field, or click the **+** button in the Values column
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Values">
    Click **Add Value**, enter a value name, and click **Add Value** to confirm. Values are simple text labels (e.g., "Apparel", "Tops", "T-Shirts").
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit Values">
    Click directly on a value name in the table to edit it inline. Edited values show a blue "(edited)" indicator.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove Values">
    Click the trash icon to mark a value for deletion. Deleted values show with strikethrough text and can be restored before saving.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save Changes** to apply all additions, edits, and deletions at once
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  The "unassigned" value is a system value that cannot be edited or deleted.
</Info>

## Assigning Hierarchy to Products

Products can be assigned hierarchy values to categorize them within your organizational structure.

### Collection-Level Hierarchy

Each collection shows its assigned hierarchy values in the **Hierarchy** tab on the collection detail page. This tab displays:

- Each active hierarchy field with its custom label
- The assigned value (or "Not set" if unassigned)
- The field level number

<Info>
  Hierarchy fields help organize your products for better reporting and management. Once configured, you can assign products to specific hierarchy values from the Product List page.
</Info>

## Using Hierarchy in Tether

### Filtering by Hierarchy

Active hierarchy fields appear as filter groups on the SKU dashboard and other views. Each field's values are shown with tri-state filtering support (include, exclude, or indifferent). An "(Unassigned)" option is also available for products without a value for that field.

### Demand Forecasting

In demand forecasting, hierarchy fields can be used to:
- Group and filter forecasts by category
- Compare performance across hierarchy values
- Organize forecast views by product categorization

## Hierarchy Design Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Business Needs">
    Choose field labels based on how you need to report and analyze:
    - How does leadership want to see performance?
    - What comparisons are meaningful?
    - How is the business organized?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Activate Only What You Need">
    You don't need to use all 5 fields:
    - 2–4 active fields is common
    - Each field adds a filter dimension to your views
    - You can always activate more fields later
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Clear, Mutually Exclusive Values">
    Each product should fit clearly into one value per field:
    - Avoid overlapping categories
    - "Active" vs "Casual" might overlap — be specific
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plan for Growth">
    Consider future product lines:
    - Leave room for new values
    - Don't make labels too specific
    - Values can be added or edited at any time
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Align with External Systems">
    If you use hierarchy in other systems:
    - Align naming where possible
    - Map values for integrations
    - Document any differences
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Renaming hierarchy values can affect how existing products are categorized. Consider the impact on reporting before making changes.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Products Not Appearing in Hierarchy Filter

**Possible causes:**
- Product doesn't have hierarchy values assigned
- The hierarchy field is not activated

**Solution:**
1. Verify the hierarchy field is active on the dashboard
2. Assign hierarchy values to products
3. Use the "(Unassigned)" filter option to find products without values

### Field Not Showing in Filters

**Possible causes:**
- Field is not activated
- No values have been added

**Solution:**
1. Activate the field with a custom label
2. Add at least one value to the field

### Cannot Delete a System Value

**Cause:** The "unassigned" value is a system value

**Solution:**
- System values like "unassigned" cannot be edited or deleted
- They are automatically managed by the system
