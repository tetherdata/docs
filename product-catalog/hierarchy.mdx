# Product Hierarchy

Product hierarchy provides a multi-level categorization system for organizing your products for reporting, filtering, and analysis. Unlike dimensions (which vary within a product), hierarchy defines how products are categorized.

## What is Product Hierarchy?

Product hierarchy is a tree structure that categorizes your products. It's commonly used for:

- **Reporting** - Aggregate data at different levels
- **Filtering** - Find products by category
- **Organization** - Logical grouping of products
- **Analysis** - Compare performance across categories

### Example Hierarchy

```
Level 1: Category
└── Level 2: Subcategory
    └── Level 3: Product Line
        └── Level 4: Sub-Line
            └── Level 5: Specific Type

Example:
Apparel
└── Tops
    └── T-Shirts
        └── Graphic Tees
            └── Band Tees
```

## Hierarchy vs. Collections vs. Dimensions

Understanding when to use each:

| Feature | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Hierarchy** | Categorization for reporting | Category > Subcategory |
| **Collections** | Group products with shared dimensions | "T-Shirts" collection |
| **Dimensions** | Product variants | Size, Color |

<Info>
  A product can belong to one collection but be categorized in multiple hierarchy paths if needed.
</Info>

## Configuring Product Hierarchy

### Access Hierarchy Settings

Navigate to **SKUs** → **Product Hierarchy** (or through Settings).

### Setting Up Hierarchy Levels

Tether supports up to 5 hierarchy levels:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Level Names">
    Name each level of your hierarchy:

    | Level | Example Name |
    |-------|--------------|
    | Level 1 | Category |
    | Level 2 | Subcategory |
    | Level 3 | Product Line |
    | Level 4 | Sub-Line |
    | Level 5 | Type |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Values for Each Level">
    Add possible values at each level:

    **Level 1 (Category):**
    - Apparel
    - Accessories
    - Footwear

    **Level 2 (Subcategory):**
    - Tops
    - Bottoms
    - Outerwear
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Valid Paths">
    Specify which level 2 values can appear under each level 1:
    - Apparel → Tops, Bottoms, Outerwear
    - Accessories → Bags, Hats, Jewelry
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Save the hierarchy structure
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Hierarchy Value Configuration

For each value, you can configure:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display name for the value |
| **Code** | Short identifier |
| **Parent** | Which value this belongs under |
| **Sort Order** | Position in lists |

## Assigning Hierarchy to Products

### Collection-Level Assignment

Assign hierarchy values to a collection:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Collection">
    Navigate to the collection's detail page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to Hierarchy Tab">
    Select the **Hierarchy** tab
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Values">
    For each hierarchy level, select the appropriate value:
    - Category: Apparel
    - Subcategory: Tops
    - Product Line: T-Shirts
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    All SKUs in the collection inherit these values
  </Step>
</Steps>

### SKU-Level Override

Individual SKUs can have different hierarchy values than their collection:

1. Open the SKU detail page
2. Navigate to the hierarchy section
3. Select different values as needed
4. Save the override

<Note>
  SKU-level hierarchy takes precedence over collection-level settings.
</Note>

## Using Hierarchy in Tether

### Filtering by Hierarchy

Hierarchy appears in filter panels throughout Tether:

1. Expand the hierarchy filter section
2. Select values at any level
3. View all products in that branch

**Example:** Selecting "Apparel" shows all products under Apparel, including all subcategories.

### Reporting with Hierarchy

Hierarchy enables multi-level reporting:

- **Top Level**: Total sales for Apparel
- **Drill Down**: Sales by Subcategory within Apparel
- **Detail**: Sales by Product Line within Subcategory

### Demand Forecasting

In demand forecasting, group by hierarchy levels to:
- View forecasts at category level
- Drill down to specific product lines
- Compare performance across categories

## Hierarchy Design Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Business Needs">
    Design hierarchy based on how you need to report and analyze:
    - How does leadership want to see performance?
    - What comparisons are meaningful?
    - How is the business organized?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep It Balanced">
    Avoid hierarchies that are too deep or too shallow:
    - 3-4 levels is common
    - Very deep hierarchies (5+ levels) can be hard to navigate
    - Very shallow hierarchies (1-2 levels) limit analysis
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Clear, Mutually Exclusive Values">
    Each product should fit clearly into one path:
    - Avoid overlapping categories
    - "Active" vs "Casual" might overlap—be specific
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plan for Growth">
    Consider future product lines:
    - Leave room for new categories
    - Don't make current structure too specific
    - Values can be added later
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Align with External Systems">
    If you use hierarchy in other systems:
    - Align naming where possible
    - Map values for integrations
    - Document any differences
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Hierarchy Patterns

### Fashion / Apparel

```
Gender
└── Category
    └── Subcategory
        └── Style

Example:
Women's
└── Tops
    └── Blouses
        └── Silk Blouses
```

### Consumer Electronics

```
Division
└── Category
    └── Product Family
        └── Product Type

Example:
Computing
└── Laptops
    └── MacBook
        └── MacBook Pro
```

### Food & Beverage

```
Category
└── Subcategory
    └── Brand
        └── Product Line

Example:
Beverages
└── Coffee
    └── Premium Roast
        └── Single Origin
```

### Home Goods

```
Room
└── Category
    └── Style
        └── Material

Example:
Bedroom
└── Bedding
    └── Modern
        └── Cotton
```

## Managing Hierarchy Changes

### Adding New Values

Adding values is straightforward:
1. Navigate to hierarchy configuration
2. Add the new value at the appropriate level
3. Assign to collections/SKUs as needed

### Renaming Values

Renaming updates displays but preserves relationships:
1. Edit the value's name
2. All products using this value update automatically
3. Historical data remains linked

### Restructuring Hierarchy

Larger changes require more care:

<Warning>
  Restructuring hierarchy can affect historical reporting. Plan carefully and consider the impact on year-over-year comparisons.
</Warning>

**Steps for restructuring:**
1. Document current structure
2. Plan new structure
3. Update hierarchy configuration
4. Reassign products to new values
5. Verify reports work correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Products Not Appearing in Hierarchy Filter

**Possible causes:**
- Product doesn't have hierarchy values assigned
- Collection doesn't have hierarchy values
- Filter is set to a different branch

**Solution:**
1. Check product/collection hierarchy settings
2. Verify values are assigned at all required levels
3. Clear and reset filters

### Hierarchy Levels Not Showing

**Possible causes:**
- Level isn't configured
- No values exist for that level
- Permissions restrict access

**Solution:**
1. Verify hierarchy configuration includes all needed levels
2. Add values to empty levels
3. Check user permissions

### Can't Delete Hierarchy Value

**Cause:** Products are assigned to this value

**Solution:**
1. Find products using this value
2. Reassign them to another value
3. Then delete the unused value
