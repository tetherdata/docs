# SKUs Overview

SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) are the foundation of your product catalog in Tether. Each SKU represents a unique product variant that can be tracked, forecasted, and managed throughout your supply chain.

## What is a SKU?

A SKU is a unique identifier for a specific product. In Tether, SKUs contain:

- **Basic Information**: Name, code, UPC, and identifiers
- **Classification**: Type, collection, and status
- **Attributes**: Dimension values (Size, Color, etc.)
- **Relationships**: Suppliers, pricing, and bill of materials

## SKU Types

Tether supports multiple SKU types to model your product structure:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Finished Good** | Products sold to customers | "Blue T-Shirt, Size M" |
| **Raw Material** | Components used in production | "Cotton Fabric" |
| **Packaging** | Packaging materials | "Shipping Box 12x12" |
| **Component** | Parts that make up other products | "Button Set" |
| **Bundle** | A group of SKUs sold together | "Gift Set" |
| **Kit** | Assembled from components | "DIY Kit" |
| **Virtual Bundle** | Logical grouping (not physically assembled) | "Buy 2 Get 1 Free" |

## The SKU Dashboard

The SKU dashboard is your central hub for managing products.

### Dashboard Layout

The dashboard consists of:

1. **Filter Panel** (left side) - Narrow down the SKU list
2. **Data Table** (center) - View and edit SKUs
3. **Actions Bar** (top) - Create SKUs, manage views, export data

### Key Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | The display name of the SKU |
| **SKU Code** | Unique identifier code |
| **UPC** | Universal Product Code (barcode) |
| **Amazon ID** | Amazon ASIN or identifier |
| **Type** | SKU type classification |
| **Collection** | Parent collection |
| **Status** | Active or Archived |
| **Dimensions** | Attribute values (Size, Color, etc.) |

### Quick Actions

From the dashboard, you can:

- **Create SKU**: Add a new product manually
- **Export**: Download SKU data as CSV/Excel
- **Manage Views**: Save and load filter configurations
- **Inline Edit**: Click cells to edit directly

## SKU Status

SKUs can have two statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Active** | SKU is in use and available for operations |
| **Archived** | SKU is hidden from most views but data is retained |

<Info>
  Archiving a SKU doesn't delete any historical data. You can always restore an archived SKU if needed.
</Info>

## Understanding SKU Relationships

### SKUs and Collections

Every SKU belongs to a collection. Collections define:

- Shared dimensions (Size, Color, etc.)
- Product hierarchy
- Bulk settings and configurations

### SKUs and Channels

SKUs are made available on channels through availability settings. A SKU might be:

- Available on all channels
- Restricted to specific channels
- Channel-specific pricing

### SKUs and Warehouses

Inventory is tracked per SKU per warehouse. A single SKU can have inventory in multiple warehouses.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Naming Conventions">
    Use consistent naming patterns:
    - Include key attributes: "Product Name - Size - Color"
    - Keep names concise but descriptive
    - Avoid special characters that might cause issues in exports
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SKU Codes">
    Create meaningful SKU codes:
    - Use a consistent format across all products
    - Include category or collection indicators
    - Make codes human-readable when possible
    - Example: `TSH-BLU-M` for T-Shirt, Blue, Medium
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Using Types Effectively">
    Choose the right SKU type:
    - Use **Finished Good** for anything you sell directly
    - Use **Component** for items that go into other products
    - Use **Bundle** when you physically assemble products together
    - Use **Virtual Bundle** for promotional groupings
  </Accordion>
