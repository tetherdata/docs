# Editing SKUs

Tether provides multiple ways to edit SKU information, from quick inline edits to comprehensive detail views. This guide covers all editing methods.

<Note>
  Editing SKUs requires Admin access. Sales Rep users have view-only access.
</Note>

## Inline Editing

The fastest way to make quick changes is directly in the SKU dashboard.

### Editable Columns

The following columns support inline editing on the dashboard:

| Column | Edit Type | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Dropdown | Select from SKU types |
| **UPC** | Text input | Barcode number |
| **Amazon ID** | Text input | ASIN or Amazon identifier |
| **Dimension Values** | Dropdown | Select from available values in the collection |

<Note>
  Name and SKU Code are **not** inline-editable on the dashboard. To edit these fields, open the SKU detail page.
</Note>

### How to Inline Edit

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the Cell">
    Find the SKU and column you want to edit. Editable cells show a subtle highlight on hover.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click to Edit">
    Click the cell to enter edit mode:
    - **Text fields**: A text input appears
    - **Dropdowns**: A selection menu appears
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Your Change">
    Type the new value or select from the dropdown.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save or Cancel">
    - Press **Enter** or click away to save
    - Press **Escape** to cancel without saving
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Use `Tab` to move to the next editable cell after saving. This speeds up bulk editing.
</Tip>

### Inline Edit Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Blue border | Cell is in edit mode |
| Green flash | Change saved successfully |
| Red border | Validation error |
| Spinner | Save in progress |

## Detail Page Editing

For comprehensive edits, open the SKU detail page by clicking on a SKU row.

### Overview Tab

The Overview tab contains basic SKU information:

**Editable Fields:**
- Name
- SKU Code
- UPC Code
- External ID (e.g., Amazon ASIN)
- SKU Type
- Unit of Measurement
- Dimension values

**Read-Only Fields:**
- Collection (displayed as a link to the collection detail page)
- Created date
- Last modified date

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the SKU">
    Click on a SKU row to open its detail page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Overview">
    Select the **Overview** tab (the default tab)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Edit Mode">
    Click the **Edit** button to toggle fields into edit mode
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Changes">
    Modify the desired fields
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save or Cancel">
    Click **Save** to commit changes or **Cancel** to discard them
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Unit Conversions

The Overview tab also lets you manage alternate units of measurement for the SKU:

- **Default Unit**: The primary unit set during SKU creation (e.g., "Yard")
- **Additional Units**: Add alternate units with conversion ratios

**Adding a Unit Conversion:**

1. Click **Add Unit** in the unit conversions section
2. Enter the alternate unit name (e.g., "Roll")
3. Enter the conversion ratio: `Default Unit × Conversion Ratio = Alternate Unit`
4. Save the conversion

<Info>
  Unit conversions are used when suppliers order in different units than your inventory tracking unit. For example, inventory tracked in yards but ordered from suppliers in rolls.
</Info>

### Pricing Tab

Configure SKU pricing by sales channel:

**What You Can Edit:**
- Channel-specific pricing
- Price values per channel

<Info>
  Pricing changes may affect demand forecasts and reporting. Review the impact before making significant price changes.
</Info>

### Inventory Tab

View inventory levels (read-only from this tab):

- Current stock by warehouse
- Inventory states (sellable, committed, on-hand)
- Health status

<Note>
  To adjust inventory, use the Inventory dashboard or create inventory adjustment transactions.
</Note>

### Suppliers Tab

View supplier associations for this SKU.

<Note>
  The Suppliers tab is only visible if the SKU belongs to a collection. Supplier details are managed through the collection or the Suppliers dashboard.
</Note>

**What's Shown:**
- Which suppliers provide this item
- Supplier-specific details (SKU codes, costs, lead times)

### Processes Tab

View manufacturing processes associated with this SKU.

<Note>
  The Processes tab is only visible if the SKU's collection has processes enabled. Process associations are read-only from this view.
</Note>

**What's Shown:**
- Associated production processes
- Process configurations for this SKU

### Bill of Materials Tab

The Bill of Materials tab has two sub-tabs:

**Components Sub-tab** — What goes into this SKU:
- Lists all materials and parts needed to make this SKU
- Columns: Component, Source, SKU Code, Quantity, Unit, Optional
- Empty state shows: "This SKU does not contain any components."

**Usage Sub-tab** — Where this SKU is used as a component:
- Lists all SKUs that use this item as a component
- Columns: Used In SKU, SKU Code, Collection, Quantity, Unit, Optional
- Helpful for understanding the impact of changes before modifying a component

<Warning>
  Changing BOM affects production planning and inventory calculations. Verify changes before saving.
</Warning>

## Bulk Editing

For editing multiple SKUs at once:

### Using Filters + Export/Import

1. Filter to the SKUs you want to edit
2. Export the filtered list to CSV
3. Make changes in your spreadsheet
4. Re-import the updated file

### Multi-Select Actions

1. Use checkboxes to select multiple SKUs
2. Access bulk actions from the toolbar:
   - Change status (Archive/Activate)
   - Move to collection
   - Apply tags

## Changing SKU Type

Changing a SKU's type has implications:

| From | To | Considerations |
|------|-----|----------------|
| Finished Good | Component | SKU won't appear in demand forecasts |
| Component | Finished Good | May need to set up channel availability |
| Any | Bundle | Need to configure component relationships |

<Warning>
  Changing SKU type can affect forecasting, inventory tracking, and channel availability. Review all implications before making this change.
</Warning>

## Archiving SKUs

To hide a SKU without deleting it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the SKU">
    Either click to open details or find it in the list
  </Step>

  <Step title="Change Status">
    Set the **Status** field to **Archived**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm">
    The SKU will be hidden from default views
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What Happens When You Archive

- SKU is hidden from standard lists
- Historical data is preserved
- Inventory records remain
- Forecasts are excluded from active views
- SKU can be restored by changing status back to Active

### Finding Archived SKUs

1. Go to the SKU dashboard
2. Open the filter panel
3. In the **Status** filter, select **Archived**
4. Archived SKUs will appear

## Editing Dimension Values

To change a SKU's dimension values (e.g., correct a wrong size):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the SKU Detail">
    Click on the SKU to open its detail page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Locate Dimension Fields">
    Find the dimension fields in the Overview section or use inline editing
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select New Value">
    Choose the correct value from the dropdown
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Confirm the change
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Dimension values must exist in the collection's dimension configuration. If you need a new value, add it to the collection's dimensions first.
</Info>

## Validation and Errors

### Common Validation Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "SKU code already exists" | Duplicate code | Use a unique code |
| "Required field missing" | Empty required field | Fill in the required data |
| "Invalid dimension value" | Value not in collection | Add value to collection dimensions |
| "Cannot change type" | Active constraints | Resolve dependencies first |

### Handling Errors

When you see a validation error:

1. Read the error message carefully
2. Correct the issue
3. Try saving again
4. If stuck, cancel and review the SKU's relationships

## Edit History

Tether tracks changes to SKUs:

- Who made the change
- When the change was made
- What was changed

This audit trail helps with troubleshooting and compliance.
