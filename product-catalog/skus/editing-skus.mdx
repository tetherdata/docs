# Editing SKUs

Tether provides multiple ways to edit SKU information, from quick inline edits to comprehensive detail views. This guide covers all editing methods.

<Note>
  Editing SKUs requires Admin access. Sales Rep users have view-only access.
</Note>

## Inline Editing

The fastest way to make quick changes is directly in the SKU dashboard.

### Editable Columns

The following columns support inline editing:

| Column | Edit Type | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Text input | Click to edit |
| **SKU Code** | Text input | Must remain unique |
| **UPC** | Text input | Barcode number |
| **Amazon ID** | Text input | ASIN or Amazon identifier |
| **Type** | Dropdown | Select from SKU types |
| **Status** | Dropdown | Active or Archived |
| **Dimension Values** | Dropdown | Select from available values |

### How to Inline Edit

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the Cell">
    Find the SKU and column you want to edit. Editable cells show a subtle highlight on hover.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click to Edit">
    Click the cell to enter edit mode:
    - **Text fields**: A text input appears
    - **Dropdowns**: A selection menu appears
  </Step>

## Bulk Editing

For editing multiple SKUs at once:

### Using Filters + Export/Import

1. Filter to the SKUs you want to edit
2. Export the filtered list to CSV
3. Make changes in your spreadsheet
4. Re-import the updated file

### Multi-Select Actions

1. Use checkboxes to select multiple SKUs
2. Access bulk actions from the toolbar:
   - Change status (Archive/Activate)
   - Move to collection
   - Apply tags

## Changing SKU Type

Changing a SKU's type has implications:

| From | To | Considerations |
|------|-----|----------------|
| Finished Good | Component | SKU won't appear in demand forecasts |
| Component | Finished Good | May need to set up channel availability |
| Any | Bundle | Need to configure component relationships |

<Warning>
  Changing SKU type can affect forecasting, inventory tracking, and channel availability. Review all implications before making this change.
</Warning>

## Archiving SKUs

To hide a SKU without deleting it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the SKU">
    Either click to open details or find it in the list
  </Step>

  <Step title="Change Status">
    Set the **Status** field to **Archived**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm">
    The SKU will be hidden from default views
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What Happens When You Archive

- SKU is hidden from standard lists
- Historical data is preserved
- Inventory records remain
- Forecasts are excluded from active views
- SKU can be restored by changing status back to Active

### Finding Archived SKUs

1. Go to the SKU dashboard
2. Open the filter panel
3. In the **Status** filter, select **Archived**
4. Archived SKUs will appear

## Editing Dimension Values

To change a SKU's dimension values (e.g., correct a wrong size):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the SKU Detail">
    Click on the SKU to open its detail page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Locate Dimension Fields">
    Find the dimension fields in the Overview section or use inline editing
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select New Value">
    Choose the correct value from the dropdown
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Confirm the change
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Dimension values must exist in the collection's dimension configuration. If you need a new value, add it to the collection's dimensions first.
</Info>

## Validation and Errors

### Common Validation Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "SKU code already exists" | Duplicate code | Use a unique code |
| "Required field missing" | Empty required field | Fill in the required data |
| "Invalid dimension value" | Value not in collection | Add value to collection dimensions |
| "Cannot change type" | Active constraints | Resolve dependencies first |

### Handling Errors

When you see a validation error:

1. Read the error message carefully
2. Correct the issue
3. Try saving again
4. If stuck, cancel and review the SKU's relationships
