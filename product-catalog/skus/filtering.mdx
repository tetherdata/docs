# Filtering & Saved Views

With potentially thousands of SKUs, finding the right products quickly is essential. Tether's filtering system helps you narrow down your view and save common filter combinations for reuse.

## The Filter Panel

The filter panel appears on the left side of the SKU dashboard. It contains multiple filter sections that work together.

### Filter Sections

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Search** | Text search across name and code |
| **SKU Type** | Filter by product type |
| **Status** | Active or Archived |
| **Collections** | Filter by parent collection |
| **Collection Hierarchy** | Filter by hierarchy levels |
| **Dimensions** | Filter by attribute values |

## Text Search

The quickest way to find a specific SKU:

1. Type in the search box at the top of the filter panel
2. Results filter as you type
3. Search matches against:
   - SKU Name
   - SKU Code
   - UPC
   - Amazon ID

<Tip>
  Use the search for quick lookups. Combine with other filters for more refined results.
</Tip>

## Filter by SKU Type

Filter products by their classification:

| Type | Shows |
|------|-------|
| Finished Good | Sellable products |
| Raw Material | Production inputs |
| Component | Parts and sub-assemblies |
| Bundle | Product bundles |
| Kit | Assembly kits |
| Virtual Bundle | Logical groupings |

**To use:**
1. Expand the **SKU Type** section
2. Check the types you want to see
3. Results update immediately

## Filter by Status

Show or hide archived products:

| Option | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Active** | Show only active SKUs |
| **Archived** | Show only archived SKUs |
| **Both** | Show all SKUs regardless of status |

<Info>
  By default, only Active SKUs are shown. Remember to include Archived if you need to find historical products.
</Info>

## Filter by Collection

Narrow down to SKUs within specific collections:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Expand Collections Filter">
    Click on the **Collections** section header
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Collections">
    - Check collections you want to include
    - Use the search box to find specific collections
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Results">
    Only SKUs in the selected collections will appear
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Collection Hierarchy Filtering

If you've set up collection hierarchies, filter by hierarchy levels:

**Example Hierarchy:**
```
Category → Subcategory → Product Line
Apparel → T-Shirts → Summer Collection
```

Filter at any level to see all SKUs below that point in the hierarchy.

## Dimension Filtering

Filter by product attributes like Size, Color, or Material.

### Available Dimensions

Dimensions shown depend on your collection configuration. Common examples:

| Dimension | Example Values |
|-----------|----------------|
| Size | S, M, L, XL, XXL |
| Color | Red, Blue, Black, White |
| Material | Cotton, Polyester, Blend |
| Style | Regular, Slim, Relaxed |

### Using Dimension Filters

<Steps>
  <Step title="Expand the Dimension Section">
    Click on the dimension name (e.g., "Size")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Values">
    Check the values you want to see
  </Step>

  <Step title="Combine Dimensions">
    Use multiple dimensions together:
    - Size: M, L
    - Color: Blue, Black
    - Shows: Medium Blue, Medium Black, Large Blue, Large Black
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tri-State Selection

Some filters support three states for more precise control:

| State | Visual | Behavior |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Include** | ✓ Checked | Show items matching this value |
| **Exclude** | ✗ Crossed | Hide items matching this value |
| **Indifferent** | Empty | Don't filter by this value |

### Example Use Case

Find all T-Shirts that are NOT Blue:

1. Select the "T-Shirts" collection (Include)
2. In the Color filter, set "Blue" to Exclude
3. Results show all T-Shirts except blue ones

<Tip>
  Click once to Include, twice to Exclude, three times to return to Indifferent.
</Tip>

## Combining Filters

Filters work together using AND logic:

- SKU Type = Finished Good **AND**
- Collection = T-Shirts **AND**
- Size = M, L **AND**
- Status = Active

This shows active finished goods in T-Shirts that are Medium or Large.

## Clearing Filters

### Clear Individual Filters

Click the **X** or **Clear** button next to each filter section.

### Clear All Filters

Click the **Clear All** button at the top of the filter panel to reset everything.

## Tips for Effective Filtering

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Broad, Then Narrow">
    Begin with larger filters (collection, type) then narrow down with specific attributes. This helps you understand the scope before diving into details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Search for Known Items">
    If you know the SKU code or name, text search is fastest. Use filters when browsing or analyzing groups of SKUs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create Views for Workflows">
    Set up saved views for your common tasks:
    - "Weekly Review - Low Stock"
    - "New Products This Month"
    - "Active Summer Items"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Remember Archived SKUs">
    If you can't find a SKU, check if it's archived. Include the Archived status in your filter to see all products.
