# Tether documentation agent instructions

This is the documentation site for **Tether**, a supply chain planning platform covering demand forecasting, inventory management, supply simulation, transactions, and integrations. All docs are written in MDX and rendered by Mintlify.

## Key files

- `docs.json` — navigation structure and site configuration. Always read this before making structural changes.
- `AGENT_TASKS.md` — task list for documentation work. **Do NOT edit this file.**

## Mintlify basics

- Use MDX format for all documentation pages
- Run `mint dev` locally to preview changes before committing
- Run `mint broken-links` to check for broken links
- See https://www.mintlify.com/docs/components for all available components

## Page structure

Every page should follow this structure (sections are optional where not applicable):

1. **Frontmatter** — `title`, `description`, and optionally `sidebarTitle`
2. **H1 heading** — matches the frontmatter title
3. **Intro paragraph** — brief context before diving into details
4. **Main content** — feature explanation, tables, steps, etc.
5. **Best practices** — use `<AccordionGroup>` with `<Accordion>` items
6. **Troubleshooting** — common issues with causes and solutions
7. **Next Steps** — a `<CardGroup cols={2}>` with exactly **4** `<Card>` links to related pages

### Next Steps pattern

```mdx
## Next Steps

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Page Title" icon="icon-name" href="/section/page">
    Brief description of what the reader will learn
  </Card>
  <!-- exactly 4 cards total -->
</CardGroup>
```

## Style and formatting

- Use active voice and second person ("you")
- Keep sentences concise — one idea per sentence
- Use sentence case for headings (e.g., "Running simulations" not "Running Simulations")
- Reference UI elements in bold: Click **Settings**
- Use code formatting for file names, commands, paths, and code references
- Use `<Steps>` with `<Step>` for sequential instructions
- Use `<Note>`, `<Tip>`, `<Info>`, and `<Warning>` for callouts
- Use tables for structured comparisons and reference data

## Terminology

Use these exact forms consistently across all pages:

| Term | Correct | Incorrect |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Stock Keeping Unit | **SKU** (always uppercase) | Sku, sku |
| Running out of stock | **stockout** (one word) | stock-out, stock out |
| Excess inventory | **overstock** (one word) | over-stock, over stock |
| Minimum inventory threshold | **safety stock** (two words) | safety-stock, safetystock |
| Time to receive goods | **lead time** (two words) | lead-time, leadtime |
| Placing new orders | **reorder** (one word) | re-order |
| Scenario analysis feature | **What-If** (hyphenated, title-case) | what if, what-if, What if |
| Online sales | **e-commerce** (hyphenated, lowercase) | ecommerce, e commerce |
| Completing orders | **fulfill** / **fulfillment** (American English) | fulfil, fulfilment |
| Live data | **real-time** (hyphenated) | realtime, real time |
| Data over time | **time series** (two words) | time-series, timeseries |
| Forecast error metric | **MAPE** (always uppercase) | mape, Mape |
| Order types | **Purchase Order**, **Transfer Order**, **Production Order** (title-case as types) | |
| Navigation verb vs noun | **set up** (verb) / **setup** (noun) | |

## Cross-linking

- Use `href="/section/page"` for `<Card>` links (root-relative paths, no `.mdx` extension)
- Use `[link text](/section/page)` for inline markdown links
- Link to related pages in other sections when content naturally references them (e.g., supply simulation pages should link to demand forecasting where forecasts are mentioned as inputs)
- Verify all links point to pages that actually exist in the repository

## Documentation sections

| Section | Path prefix | Covers |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Getting Started | `/` (root) | Index, quickstart, navigation, roles |
| Product Catalog | `/product-catalog/` | SKUs, collections, dimensions, hierarchy |
| Inventory Management | `/inventory/` | Dashboard, supply plan, forecasts, warehouses, suppliers |
| Demand Forecasting | `/demand-forecasting/` | Dashboard, filtering, editing, algorithms, comparison, admin, promotions |
| Transactions | `/transactions/` | Overview, types, creating, detail view, workflow |
| Sales Channels | `/channels/` | Overview, managing, hierarchy |
| Supply Simulation | `/supply-simulation/` | Running, configurations, charts, what-if |
| Integrations | `/integrations/` | Setup, sync sessions, troubleshooting |
| Analytics | `/analytics/` | Metrics |
| Administration | `/administration/` | User access, terminology, inventory settings, periods |
| Tips & Shortcuts | `/tips/` | Command palette, shortcuts, bulk operations, exports |

## What to avoid

- Don't edit `docs.json` without understanding the full navigation structure
- Don't edit `AGENT_TASKS.md`
- Don't remove existing pages without checking for inbound links (grep for the page path)
- Don't use HTML when an MDX component exists for the same purpose
- Don't add pages to `docs.json` navigation that don't exist yet as `.mdx` files
- Don't use British English spellings (use "optimize" not "optimise", "analyze" not "analyse")
- Don't break the 4-card pattern in Next Steps sections
